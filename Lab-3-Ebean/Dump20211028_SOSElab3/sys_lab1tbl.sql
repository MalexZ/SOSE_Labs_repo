Deployments to date, however, have concentrated on new applications, and existing Web-based applications. A host of legacy applications and protocols continue to exist in their native forms, outdated, yet entrenched due to large installed bases. This paper details our observations in integrating a Web service infrastructure into the simple network management protocol (SNMP). SNMP has been in use for over a decade and a half, predominantly in network equipment embedded systems. Our Web service-based approach allows us to enhance our existing application with XML/SOAP interoperability, SSL/TLS security, and the potential to migrate both application and protocol layers to encompass future extensions and Web browser accessibility. The difficulty with SNMP, and many other legacy networking protocols, is that much of the extensive installed base is hosted on limited capability, legacy hardware. While the benefits of our scheme are quite tangible, the performance impact of adding these features is not well known. We examine two approaches, an integrated solution using a light-weight HTTP/SOAP stack, as well as a standard Java Web server implementation. Our tests reveal unanticipated performance results through both the integrated and proxy methods. We discuss the impact of these anomalies on the viability of our approach and address the broad issue of migrating Web services to legacy embedded architectures.'),(4220,'conf/icws/ChenCSL03','Chen Zhou||Liang-Tien Chia||Bilhanan Silverajan||Bu-Sung Lee','UX- An Architecture Providing QoS-Aware and Federated Support for UDDI.','171-176','2003','conf/icws/2003',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,NULL,'db/conf/icws/icws2003.html#ChenCSL03','Las Vegas, NV',NULL),(4221,'conf/icws/Etzion04','Opher Etzion','Complex Event Processing.',NULL,'2004','conf/icws/2004',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2004.1314714','db/conf/icws/icws2004.html#Etzion04','San Diego, CA','Gartner has determined that “Complex Event Processing” (CEP) is one of the emerging areas on the rise in the “hype cycle” and become dominant in the area of Business Process Integration and Management (BPIM) as well as other areas (such as: command and control).

However, effectively reusing arbitrary granularities of SPFs has not been solved yet. In this paper, we propose a novel method of SPF reuse, named SCKY, based on the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm. We first present an extended CKY to do SPF-query.

However, it cannot make recommendations for users that have invoked only a very small number of services because of data sparsity. In addition, these methods do not know how confident they are in their recommendations. Based on the fact that QoS values of web services are usually subject to the locations of users, a few works assume that the additional knowledge of users\' locations can be used to better deal with the data sparsity issue, since a user only needs to know the users near to him/her. On the other hand, the sparsity of user-service invocations forces the location-aware method to consider the QoS experiences of users not near enough, which may decrease its precision. In order to find a good trade-off between coverage and precision, we propose a random walk method combining location-aware and collaborative filtering method for web service recommendation. The random walk method allows us to define and to measure the confidence of a recommendation.

The A-WSCE framework offers a way to adapt by defining multiple workflows and switching among them in case of component failure or changes in the QoS parameters. However, the A-WSCE framework suffers from the limitations imposed by a simple strategy of periodically checking the QoS offerings of randomly picked providers in order to decide whether the current workflow is optimal. To address these limitations, we associate the value of changed information (VOC) with each workflow and utilize the VOC to update which workflow to execute.

The location of a service represents its position in the network, which determines the transmission cost of calling this service in the composite service. The more concentrated the invoking services are, the less transmission time the composite service costs. On the other hand, the more and more popular big data processing services, which need to transfer mass data as input, make the effect much more obvious than ever before. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce service location as a basic feature in service selection. The definition and membership functions of service location are presented in this paper. After that, the optimal service selection problem is represented as an optimization problem under some reasonable assumptions.

Current composition approaches only focus on optimizing a single process to maximize the satisfaction degree for one party. When multiple processes are performed concurrently by their selfish users in a dynamic resource-constrained environment, new issues will arise, i.e., undesirable competition for service resources, extra waiting and frequent change of contexts. To address these issues, this paper aims to optimize QoS-aware services composition for multiple selfish users if the communication among users is allowed.

Then based on this model, we present fault handling mechanisms before and during the execution of concurrent composite services for concurrent processes based on a multi-issue negotiation protocol among agents, and an adaptive context-aware service re-selection mechanism for adjusting the service execution plan for each running composite service in the dynamic resource-constrained environment.

But their great drawback, the invocation overhead, has not been a research focus. So far, only invocations of simple Web services were considered. But Web service composition may create additional performance problems. Our measurements demonstrate that Web service composition may reduce the maximal load of a system drastically. The reduction quotient increases quasi-exponentially with the number of service compositions. We call that phenomenon \"service congestion\" since it is not due to the combined payload of the composed services. Such detrimental performance effects can not be tolerated in many areas. For that reason, we propose an optimized service composition architecture as a solution. This service component architecture uses service connectors on top of standard Web service middleware. It optimizes automatically the local invocation of services with a Lookup&amp;Service bus. The result is that no service congestion occurs since local service invocations have the cost of local calls'),(4272,'conf/icws/LeePCG04','Yugyung Lee||Chintan Patel||Soon Ae Chun||James Geller','Towards Intelligent Web Services for Automating Medical Service Composition.','384-','2004','conf/icws/2004',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2004.1314762','db/conf/icws/icws2004.html#LeePCG04','San Diego, CA','The vision of the Semantic Web is to reduce manual discovery and usage of Web resources (documents and services) and to allow software agents to automatically identify these Web resources, integrate them and execute them for achieving the intended goals of the user.

An important aspect of the clustering process is calculating the semantic similarity of Web services. Most current clustering approaches are based on similarity-distance measurement, including keyword, ontology and information-retrieval-based methods. Problems with these approaches include a shortage of high quality ontologies and a loss of semantic information. In addition, there has been little fine-grained improvement in existing approaches to service clustering. In this paper, we present a new approach to grouping Web services into functionally similar clusters by mining Web service documents and generating an ontology via hidden semantic patterns present within the complex terms used in service features to measure similarity. If calculating the similarity using the generated ontology fails, the similarity is calculated by using an information-retrieval-based term-similarity method that adopts term-similarity measuring techniques used by thesaurus and search engines. Another important aspect of high performance in clustering is identifying the most suitable cluster center. To improve the utility of clusters, we propose an approach to identifying the cluster center that combines service similarity with the term frequency-inverse document frequency values of service names.

They may come from sensors, smart meters, application logs, monitoring software etc. The data need to be processed in realtime to gain actionable insights. Services like smart grid load balancing, cloud platform maintenance, can be carried out in an efficient way. Stream processing is the programming paradigm that answers such demand. When talking about stream processing, we can easily recall several famous open-source software frameworks such as Spark Streaming, Samza, Flink and Storm. Although they provide distributed, robust, low-latency stream processing engines, it\'s still difficult for an end user to set up a usable stream processing application from scratch. Firstly, users are required to write code to define their business related stream processing logic. Secondly, the submission and update of the stream processing logic require service restart, therefore it may lead to service unavailability for minutes. Thirdly, extra operation effort are required for handling scaling and failover issues. In this paper, we present RTA, a released research service on realtime data processing. The RTA service fills the gap between the stream processing requester and the existing software stacks. It offers a SQL-like stream query language for defining stream processing logic definition over streaming data. It allows users easily define their stream processing logic without programming. In RTA service, stream processing logic is also treated as a type of input, which enables online logic update without service downtime. The RTA service also provides scalability, high availability and resource isolation for serving multiple tenants.

However, the customers usually adopted composite services to satisfy complex and coarse-grained requirements.

It has been shown that in-memory data processing systems suffer from serious memory pressure. The situation becomes even worse for the service-oriented data processing systems due to various reasons. For example, in a service-oriented system, multiple submitted tasks are launched at the same time and executed in the same context in the resources, compared with the batch processing mode where the tasks are processed one by one. Therefore, the memory pressure will affect all submitted tasks, including the tasks that only incur the light memory pressure when they are run alone. In this paper, we find that the reason why memory pressure arises is because the running tasks produce massive long-living data objects in the limited memory space. Our studies further reveal that the long-living data objects are generated by the API functions that are invoked by the in-memory processing frameworks. Based on these findings, we propose a method to classify the API functions based on the memory usage rate. Further, we design a scheduler called MURS to mitigate the memory pressure. We implement MURS in Spark and conduct the experiments to evaluate the performance of MURS. The results show that when comparing to Spark, MURS can 1) decrease the execution time of the submitted jobs by up to 65.8%, 2) mitigate the memory pressure in the server by decreasing the garbage collection time by up to 81%, and 3) reduce the data spilling, and hence disk I/O, by approximately 90%.'),(4280,'conf/icws/Jimenez-PerisPMN07','Ricardo Jiménez-Peris||Marta Patiño-Martínez||Ernestina Martel-Jordán||R.

The result of the evaluation process can be used to enrich existing Web service descriptions with a set of up-to-date QoS attributes, therefore, making it a valuable instrument for Web service selection'),(4297,'conf/icws/SchonbergerSW11','Andreas Schönberger||Johannes Schwalb||Guido Wirtz','Has WS-I\'s Work Resulted in Ws-* Interoperability?','171-178','2011','conf/icws/2011',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.42','db/conf/icws/icws2011.html#SchonbergerSW11','Washington DC','Recently, the Web Services Interoperability Organization(WS-I) has announced to have completed its interoperability standards work.

To answer this question, we thoroughly analyze two important Web Services stacks for interoperability of WS-Security and WS-Reliable Messaging features. Our analysis shows that security and reliability features are far from being implemented in an interoperable manner.

However, traditional, supervised outlier detection is not well suited for problems such as network intrusion detection, where proper labelled data is scarce. This has created a focus on extending these approaches to be unsupervised, removing the need for explicit labels, but at a cost of poorer performance compared to their supervised counterparts. Recent work has explored ways of making up for this, such as creating ensembles of diverse models, or even diverse learning algorithms, to jointly classify data. While using unsupervised, heterogeneous ensembles of learning algorithms has been proposed as a viable next step for research, the implications of how these ensembles are built and used has not been explored.'),(4299,'conf/icws/SchmidtGWAHLK18','Florian Schmidt||Anton Gulenko||Marcel Wallschläger||Alexander Acker||Vincent Hennig||Feng Liu||Odej Kao','IFTM - Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Virtualized Network Function Services.','187-194','2018','conf/icws/2018',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2018.00031','db/conf/icws/icws2018.html#SchmidtGWAHLK18','San Francisco','Telecommunication system providers move their IP multimedia subsystems to virtualized services in the cloud. For such systems, dedicated hardware solutions provided a reliability of 99.999% in the past. Although virtualization offers more cost efficient usage of such services, it comes with higher complexity for providing reliable running software components due to the fragile computation stack. In order to hide the impact of such problematic behaviors, automatic mechanisms may help to detect degraded state anomalies in order to execute remediation actions. This work introduces IFTM as a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in a distributed environment based on real-time monitoring data. The proposed approach consists of two key concepts using an automatic identity function and threshold learning to distinguish between normal and abnormal system behaviors. The evaluation is performed on a testbed running an open source implementation of the IP multimedia subsystem (Clearwater) executed on a replicated Openstack cloud environment. Results show the applicability of IFTM with high detection rates (98%) and low number of false alarms.'),(4300,'conf/icws/TanD09','Kar Way Tan||Robert H.

The documents are transported within the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages and travel through multiple intermediary entities, each potentially makes changes to the data in the documents. The WS-security provides integrity protection by allowing portions of a SOAP message to be signed using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) signature scheme. This method however, has not considered the situation where a portion of data may be modified by another entity, therefore a need to allow the originating system to control which intermediary entity is authorized to change which portion of the data. The XML signature scheme also does not provide the final recipient the trust for the intermediary entity that makes the changes. In our paper, we study the security requirements for a streamlined business process, and proposes a novel scheme using sanitizable signature on SOAP messages to complement the XML signature to address not only integrity protection but also control of change as well as establishment of trust for intermediary entities. We show how the proposed scheme can be incorporated into the existing standards and be customizable to achieve flexible use of both the vanilla and sanitizable signatures as required in a business scenario.

Thus, it is significant to evaluate the trustworthiness of the service providers along the social trust paths from a service consumer to a service provider. However, there are usually many social trust paths between an unknown service consumer and service provider. Thus, a challenging problem is how to effectively and effciently find those social trust paths that can yield trustworthy trust evaluation results based on the requirements of a service consumer particularly in the real-time OSN environments. In this paper, we first present a contextual trust-oriented social network structure and a concept of Quality of Trust (QoT). We then model the multiple social trust paths finding with end-to-end QoT constraints as the Multiple Constrained K Optimal Paths (MCOP-K) selection problem, which is NP-Complete. To deal with this challenging problem, based on the Monte Carlo method and our optimization search strategies, we propose a new efficient and effective approximation algorithm D-MCBA. The results of our experiments conducted on a real-world dataset of OSNs illustrate that D-MCBA can efficiently identify the social trust paths with better quality than our previously proposed MONTE K algorithm that is the most promising algorithm for the social trust path finding in OSNs.'),(4303,'conf/icws/HeilGM08','Andreas Heil||Martin Gaedke||Johannes Meinecke','Identifying Security Aspects in Web-Based Federations.','807-808','2008','conf/icws/2008',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.49','db/conf/icws/icws2008.html#HeilGM08','Beijing, China','Today\'s Web applications and their respective business processes reside under the control of different organizations.

A trusted component is defined as a reusable software element possessing specified and guaranteed property qualities. The highly reusable nature of a Web service emphasizes the need for a \"trust ensuring\" mechanism between the requester and the provider of the service. The focus of this paper is to suggest a fortified Web services architecture introducing the concept of contracts to increase the level of trust between the requester and the provider of the requested service. In order to achieve this goal a new language is introduced into the fortified Web services architecture: WS-Contract. WS-Contract is a machine-processable specification of the Web service semantics, formally supporting the different levels of contract information. It defines the pre-and post conditions of the Web services interface, the synchronization policy of the service and the QoS parameters that should be maintained between the requester agent and the provider agent.

In this paper, we highlight the importance of UI design specification in the SOA landscape, from a service- identification perspective. Service identification, which is a key activity in any SOA-based development, involves specification of business requirements as a set of granular service definitions. We propose an approach for harvesting the UI design specification to define service requirements for the intended system; more specifically in terms of information and business service requirements. Our approach consists of the following steps: (1) capture user interface design in a format amenable to automated analysis, with appropriate references to data and process models, (2) identify requirements for information services from data that is displayed in the user interface, and (3) identify business service requirements from the UI navigation flow and the links between the UI and the business process model. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study using the Amazon associate Web services. The study demonstrates how the use of UI designs can lead to better service identification.

For these web service providers, the cost of cloud computing usage becomes a big part of their IT department cost. Facing the diverse pricing models including on-demand, reserved, and spot instance, it is difficult for web service providers to optimize their cost. This paper introduces a new cloud brokerage service to help web service providers to minimize their cloud computing cost for deadline-constrained batch jobs, which have been a significant workload in web services. Our cloud brokerage service associates each batch job with deadline, and always tries to use cheaper reserved instances for computation to maintain a minimum cost.

When developing and designing SOA applications using Model Driven Development (MDD), business processes and services are represented using specifications such as Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML based models help in specifying structural properties of services and the behavioral properties of a service composition, executing a business process. In a typical design scenario, architects develop process models (comprising of tasks) and service design independently and establish associations between tasks and the designed services. Service compositions representing business processes are verified with the designed services. Verification at design time is a manual activity and relies on the static information captured in these UML models. In this paper we describe a model-based approach that enables executing service compositions at design time. The process model and service model is transformed to an executable UML model and UML Action language (UAL) code fragments are automatically generated. UAL enables unambiguous specification of the behavior of service operations and their compositions. The generated executable model enables a precise behavior analysis of the process realization.

Based on the meta-model of aSOA, a set of aSOA patterns is generated by composing aMEPs. Then, an aSOA pattern is selected and transformed to a platform specific aSOA on top of Web services standards.

A key difference between our model and existing semantic Web service models like OWLS is that it describes the inputs and outputs in terms of instance-based graph patterns, rather than in terms of concepts. This allows associating a rich set of constraints on the input and output data in terms of relations between instances. We also propose a composition model for Web service operations, that describes the conditions for composing services into workflows. The composition model includes the notion of semantic propagation, i.e. the semantic description of the output message of an operation depends on the semantics of the input message.

The key for achieving survivable and maintainable distributed systems is agility because the non-deterministic nature of distribution would otherwise leave the system uncontrollable, especially in emerging mobile ad-hoc networks. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is based on a self-organizing and rapidly deployed network of mobile services to collaborate without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. Survivability is defined as the capability of a service to fulfil its mission in a timely manner, even in the presence of attacks, failures, or accidents. There are four key survivability properties: resistance, recognition, recovery and adaptation. Recovery, a hallmark of survivability, is the capability to maintain critical components and resource during attack, limit the extent of damage, and restore full services following attack. Exception handling is a way to deal with the recovery aspect of survivability. Resistance can be viewed as the process of limiting access to critical and vulnerable resources only to authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems. This paper bridges the analysis of secure business process and its recovery aspect in terms of exception handling in the context of access control requirements.

Therefore, it becomes tedious and cumbersome tasks for users to discover and compose services. To reduce user\'s cognitive burden, it is critical to support automated service composition and make efficient recommendation of personalized services to achieve user\'s overall goals. However, existing approaches only offer users with limited options designed for the interest of a group of users without considering individual users\' interests. To allow users to compose personalized services without much manual specification, we propose a machine learning approach that applies a learning-to-rank algorithm, RankBoost, to automatically learn user preferences and the prioritization of the preferences from users\' historical data. Moreover, our approach uses the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm to make trade-offs among user preferences and recommends a collection of services to achieve the highest objective.

It is thus crucial that the use of Web services, stand-alone or composed, provide strong security guarantees. Web services security encompasses several requirements that can be described along the well known security dimensions, that is: integrity, whereby a message must remain unaltered during transmission; confidentiality, whereby the contents of a message cannot be viewed while in transit, except by authorized services; availability, whereby a message is promptly delivered to the intended recipient, thus ensuring that legitimate users receive the services they are entitled to. Moreover, each Web service must protect its own resources against unauthorized access. This in turn requires suitable means for: identification, whereby the recipient of a message must be able to identify the sender; authentication, whereby the recipient of a message needs to verify the claimed identity of the sender; authorization, whereby the recipient of a message needs to apply access control policies to determine whether the sender has the right to use the required resources.

Traditionally, the relevance of a service is determined by computing an overall score that aggregates individual QoS values. Users are required to assign weights to QoS attributes. This is a rather demanding task and an imprecise specification of the weights could result in missing some user desired services. Recent approaches focus on computing service skyline over a set of QoS aspects. This can completely free users from assigning weights to QoS attributes. However, two main drawbacks characterize such approaches. First, the service skyline often privileges services with a bad compromise between different QoS attributes. Second, as the size of the service skyline may be quite large, users will be overwhelmed during the service selection process. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, called alpha-dominant service skyline, to address the above issues and we develop a suitable algorithm for computing it efficiently.

Coupling these criteria allows us to further constrain and select valid compositions.

The SP acts as a liaison between subscribers and partners. One of the main functions of the SP, therefore, is to match the \"demand\" of the subscribers with the \"supply\" of the CPs. Such a matching is a prerequisite for efficient service selection while ensuring customer satisfaction, and is useful for optimisation, such as resource allocation and load balancing. The \"demand\" requirements and \"supply\" guarantees can be concretized using service level agreements (SLAs). SLAs can be expressed formally using standards such as WSLA or WS-Agreement. We present a system that automates the task of finding a matching between these two sets, subscriber-SP and SP-CP, of SLAs. First, the SLAs are normalised to a common denominator, then composed if required, and finally the matching engine computes and outputs the map. The matching algorithm, which is of central importance, compares logical expressions involving predicates. The logical expressions are first converted into CNF-form, and instead of naive O(m times n) comparisons, we develop a more efficient approach to solve the problem.

However, some queries can take hours or days, either because they require non-index scans of the largest tables, or because they request very large result sets, or because they represent very complex aggregations of the data. These \"monster queries\" not only take a long time, they also affect response times for everyone else - one or more of them can clog the entire system. To ameliorate this problem, we developed a multiserver multiqueue batch job submission, execution, and tracking system for the CAS called CasJobs. The transfer of very large result sets from queries over the network is another serious problem. Statistics suggested that much of this data transfer is unnecessary; users would prefer to store results locally in order to allow further joins and filtering. To allow local analysis, a system was developed that gives users their own personal databases (MyDB) at the server side. Users may transfer data to their MyDB, and then perform further analysis before extracting it to their own machine.

It is a challenge to ensure the services generated from a choreography always have sufficient and correct channels to complete their collaboration. In fact, WS-CDL is not ready for rigorous validation and implementation with respect to channel passing, since it provides no structure for specifying explicitly which role should firstly initialize which channel variable. Here we propose an algorithm to uncover these implicit assumptions, that is implemented as an extension to Pi4SOA. With the help of the algorithm, some existing methods for verification and implementation can be applied on choreographies written in WS-CDL. In addition, we propose an approach to detect design defects in choreographies, and show how a defect is found from the main sample choreography in WS-CDL Primer.

The proposed strategy first employs MF to partition existing users into a set of user groups. In practice, only a small amount of user-service interaction information is observed. The MF based user partitioning scheme also provides a way to estimate the missing interaction information based on the group structure. The tree learning algorithm then leverages these estimated information and exploits user groups as class labels to learn a decision tree. Few highly discriminative services are identified as tree nodes to adaptively query a new user based on the interaction results with the prior services in the tree. Through a short and intuitive bootstrapping process, the new user is classified into one of the user groups, via which the user\'s preference is predicted. We conduct a set of experiments on real-world service data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bootstrapping strategy.'),(4385,'conf/icws/StefansenRS08','Christian Stefansen||Sriram K.

Most of the existing log parsing methods focus on offline, batch processing of logs. However, as the volume of logs increases rapidly, model training of offline log parsing methods, which employs all existing logs after log collection, becomes time consuming. To address this problem, we propose an online log parsing method, namely Drain, that can parse logs in a streaming and timely manner. To accelerate the parsing process, Drain uses a fixed depth parse tree, which encodes specially designed rules for parsing. We evaluate Drain on five real-world log data sets with more than 10 million raw log messages. The experimental results show that Drain has the highest accuracy on four data sets, and comparable accuracy on the remaining one. Besides, Drain obtains 51.85%~81.47% improvement in running time compared with the state-of-the-art online parser.

This type of behaviours extremely reduces the enthusiasm of honest users, which may lead a crowdsourcing platform to a failure. To defend the threats from spam workers, reputation-based defense mechanisms and verification-based defense mechanisms have been proposed in crowdsourcing environments. However, reputation-based defense fails to indicate the trust level of a worker who boosts its reputation by transacting with his/her accomplices. In addition, verification-based defense is costly and ineffective when facing a large number of spam workers with \"good\" reputations. Thus, it is a challenging problem to effectively defend the threats from spam workers. In this paper, we propose a new trust vector-based threat defense model CrowdDefense. Firstly, we build a Crowdsourcing Trust Network (CTN) consisting of requesters, workers and their transaction relations. Then, we analyze three threat patterns of spam workers. Based on the analysis, we infer the trust relation between a worker and a requester who are indirectly linked with each other. Moreover, we compute a worker\'s trust relations with different requesters, and present them in a new Worker Trust Vector (WTV) that indicates the worker\'s global trust. As spam workers always succeed in the transactions with their accomplices, they cannot obtain comprehensively good trust scores in their WTVs and thus are prevented from participating in tasks. The experiments demonstrate that CrowdsDefense significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of preventing spam workers from participating in the tasks published by honest requesters.'),(4402,'conf/icws/ModekurthyFLL15','Venkata P.

This is because, consumers personal preferences on multiple non-functional attributes such as price, material, accuracy and schedule, should be considered for AMW service selection. The decentralized nature of AMW services coupled by the need to consider consumers personal preferences during AMW service selection, requires a system that will serve as a broker between AMW services and consumers. In this paper, we propose a service broker system for AMW services that provides consumers with a single point of access to a large number of AMW services from many additive manufacturing service providers. This broker system also incorporates the first real application of service selection with fuzzy logic based personalized preferences and trade-off.

IoT devices may push notifications of sensor data in a high frequency. To enable push notification for both of mobile devices and IoT devices, the push notification system is required to achieve high throughput to handle the frequent notifications, and support content matching to filter out the undesired notifications. To enable effective push notification with both human and IoT devices involved, the system is required to understand the users\' interests for notifications with the IoT devices providing the users\' contexts. That is to say users need an intelligent push notification system. In this paper we propose a high performance context-aware push notification system for the converged mobile and IoT messaging. We designed high performance content matching engine as the core to enable efficient message dispatching for push notification according to highly personalized interest to ensure IoT messages to be involved in push notification. A user\'s interest of notifications is highly related with his context. Therefore, based on the content-matching engine, a framework for efficient context information fusion is built to support various types of context-aware push notification, towards intelligent push notification.

To deal with this problem, a carefully designed online algorithm can be employed to guide users in acquiring instances without any prior knowledge of future demands while guaranteeing a competitive ratio.

It is observed that traditional similarity mining process would very likely generate relatively big deviations of QoS values, due to the dynamic change of contexts. As a consequence, including a considerable amount of deviated QoS values in the similarity calculation would probably result in a poor accuracy for predicting unknown QoS values. In allusion to this problem, this paper first distinguishes two definitions of Abnormal Data and True Abnormal Data, the latter of which should be eliminated.

The interactions of SOAP messages between Web services form the theoretical model of SOAP message exchange patterns (MEP).

These sensors are continuously producing a huge amount of time series data, which creates a correspondingly huge demand for time series data analysis, such as pattern searching. However, analysis on time series data is currently implemented as custom applications, a strategy that suffers from low efficiency and high maintenance costs. Hence there is a need to provide a service for analysis on time series data that reduces maintenance costs and enhances query efficiency. Existing time series data management services lack the capability to perform pattern searches on the massive amount of data from sensors. This paper presents Time Series analytics as a Service (TSaaaS), a scalable analytic service for time series data in IoT scenarios. We designed pattern searching in TSaaaS that can support efficient and effective searching on truly massive amounts of time series data with very little overhead on the IoT system. To simplify access to the TSaaaS, we created a group of RESTful web interfaces. TSaaaS is implemented as an extension to the Time Series Database service in the IBM cloud platform offering (Codename: BlueMix), which is a new product to accelerate IoT application development. TSaaaS targets a future release of the Time Series Database service. We have conducted proofs of concept (PoC) of TSaaaS with real-world customers from power meter management and bridge monitoring in China. The pilot results and other experiments show that for a selection of pattern cases provided by customers, pattern searches via our service are 10-100 times faster than the existing techniques, while the additional storage cost for the service provider accounts for only about 0.4% of original time series data.'),(4415,'conf/icws/ZhangKL10','Jia Zhang||Daniel Kuc||Shiyong Lu','Confucius: A Scientific Collaboration System Using Collaborative Scientific Workflows.','575-583','2010','conf/icws/2010',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.103','db/conf/icws/icws2010.html#ZhangKL10','Miami, FL','Large-scale scientific data management and analysis usually relies on many distributed scientists with diverse expertise.

However, it is difficult to determine if a desired new service can be built from existing services. Not only the functional consistency of the existing services, but also the consistency of their non-functional (such as security) aspects must be verified. Message protection is an aspect of security. Every service needs an appropriate security policy defining the protection of messages exchanged between the parties to the service. Because of the intricacy of the Web services security policy language, it is difficult to verify the consistency of the security policies. We are developing a method to verify the consistency of security policies by abstracting them.

It is highly desirable (for reasons of security, revenue, ownership, availability etc.) for service providers that content that will undergo further processing be fetched in a prescribed fashion, preferably through a supplied Web services. In fact, monetization of partnerships within a services ecosystem normally means that Web site data translate into valuable revenue. Unfortunately, it is quite commonplace for arbitrary developers to extract or leverage information from websites without asking for permission and or negotiating a revenue sharing agreement. This may translate to significant lost income for content providers. Even in cases where Web site owners are happy to share the data, they may want users to adopt dedicated Web service APIs (and associated API-servers) rather than putting a load on their revenue-generating websites.

To ensure that users experience the best Quality of Service (QoS) with respect to their quality needs, service composition has to be QoS-aware. Establishing QoS-aware service compositions entails efficient service selection taking into account the QoS requirements of users. A challenging issue towards this purpose is to consider service selection under global QoS requirements (i.e., Requirements imposed by the user on the whole task), which is of high computational cost. This challenge is even more relevant when we consider the dynamics, limited computational resources and timeliness constraints of ubiquitous environments. To cope with the above challenge, in this paper we present QASSA, an efficient service selection algorithm that provides the appropriate ground for QoS-aware service composition in ubiquitous environments. The contribution of QASSA is three-fold. First, it formulates service selection under global QoS requirements as a set-based optimisation problem, benefiting from recent proposals in the domain of multi-objective optimisation. Second, QASSA resolves this problem in an efficient way using clustering techniques, namely the K-Means algorithm. Third, QASSA is devised in two versions, viz., centralised and distributed versions, so that it can be executed on top of centralised and decentralised infrastructures in ubiquitous environments. Results of experimental studies are presented to illustrate the timeliness and optimality of QASSA.'),(4426,'conf/icws/CarminatiFT15','Barbara Carminati||Elena Ferrari||Ngoc Hong Tran','A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Constrained Choreographed Service Composition.','297-304','2015','conf/icws/2015',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.48','db/conf/icws/icws2015.html#CarminatiFT15','New York, NY','One of the major goals of Web services is to make easier their composition to form more complex services, modeled as workflows. A key role in the Web services composition is the selection of a proper service for each activity in the workflow. In general, this requires the exchange of sensitive information of users, requiring the composition, as well as of involved service providers. So far this problem has been investigated in the setting of orchestrated service composition, under the assumption of the presence of a broker coordinating the composition. However, a promising alternative approach is the one of choreography, where each service involved in the service composition has to locally manage service selection and invocation. In this paper, we propose a framework to enforce user and provider requirements in the scenario of service choreography in a privacy-preserving way, that is, without the releasing of any private information of users and providers. To achieve this result we make use of different privacy-preserving protocols.

In addition to residual defects, the reliabilities of these types of systems can be affected by their execution context, message transmission media, and their usages. We present a case study to demonstrate that the reliability of a service varies on an hourly basis, and reliability forecasts should be recalibrated accordingly. In this study, the failure behavior of a required external service, used by a provided service, was monitored for two months to compute the initial estimates, which then continuously re-computed based on the learning of the new failure patterns.

Service clustering has been demonstrated as a promising solution by automatically detecting functionally similar services so that they can be searched and discovered together. In this way, both the efficiency and accuracy of service discovery can be improved. However, the autonomous nature of service providers leads to highly diverse usage of terms in their respective service descriptions. Furthermore, a typical service description is comprised of very limited terms due to the small number of (and focused) functionalities offered by the service. These unique characteristics make service descriptions different from regular text documents, which poses additional challenges when clustering large-scale services. Recent works show that service clustering can benefit from discovery and use of functionality-related latent factors to represent services as opposed to a large and diverse set of terms. Nonetheless, how to determine the total number of latent functional factors and sparsely assign them to each service description arises as a central challenge, especially for a large service space where there is no easy way to enumerate the types of different functionalities. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method that automatically learns the number of latent functional factors in a service space. It also enforces the sparsity constraint, which allows each service to be represented by a small number of latent functional factors. The sparsity constraint is in line with the fact that most real-world services only provide limited functionalities. We conduct extensive experiments on two sets of real-world service data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed service clustering approach.'),(4460,'conf/icws/Abu-GhazalehL06','Nayef Abu-Ghazaleh||Michael J.

DDS works by checkpointing the state of the SOAP deserializer at various points while deserializing a message, and using those checkpoints to avoid full deserialization of similar messages. DDS can improve performance in many cases, but its benefit is limited by the potentially significant memory and processing overhead associated with its checkpointing mechanism. Differential checkpointing (DCP) substantially reduces memory use, but still requires significant processing overhead. In this paper, we introduce lightweight checkpointing (LCP), a checkpointing approach that significantly reduces the cost of both DDS and DCP, in terms of both memory use and processing time. LCP statically determines locations in the incoming message where it would be most efficient to create checkpoints. LCP creates checkpoints much faster than both our original DDS checkpointing mechanism and our DCP approach. LCP also has significantly smaller memory requirements. For example, in some of our test cases, LCP requires only 10% of the memory that DCP requires, and only 3% of the memory that our original approach required. In terms of processing time, deserialization with LCP is approximately 50% to 60% faster than without differential deserialization, when approximately half the message is unchanged from the previous message'),(4461,'conf/icws/ChangK07','Jae-Woo Chang||Young-Jin Kim','XML Document Retrieval System Supporting Multimedia Web Service for Digital Museum.','1001-1007','2007','conf/icws/2007',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2007.198','db/conf/icws/icws2007.html#ChangK07','Salt Lake City, UT','In this paper, we develop an XML document retrieval system supporting a multimedia Web service for a digital museum.

The trust value of a service provider is usually in the range of [0, 1] and is evaluated from the ratings given by service clients, which represent the subjective belief of service clients on the satisfaction of delivered services. So a trust value can be taken as a subjective probability, by which one party believes that another party can perform an action in a certain situation. Hence, subjective probability theory should be adopted in trust evaluation. In addition, in SOC environments, a service provider usually can invoke the services from other service providers forming a composite service. Thus, the global trust of a composite service should be evaluated based on both the subjective probability property of trust and complex invocation structures. In this paper, we first interpret the trust dependency caused by direct service invocations as conditional probability. Then, on the basis of trust dependency, we propose a Subjective probability based deductive (SELECTIVE) approach to evaluate the subjective global trustworthiness of a composite service. All these processes follow subjective probability theory and keep the subjective probability property of trust in evaluations.

Since web services have been enhanced with formal semantic descriptions, it becomes conceivable to exploit and reason on their semantic links (i.e., semantic matching between their functional output and input parameters) to infer data flow. Our approach has been directed to meet the main challenges facing the latter problem i.e., how to effectively i) guarantee whether a data flow is well-formed and ii) infer data flow between services based on their Description Logics (DL) descriptions.

By using a standard description language and protocol, services can be used to wrap legacy software systems to be integrated beyond the enterprise boundary across heterogeneous platforms. Nevertheless, the challenges come in tandem with the opportunities because of the inherent dynamic characteristics within a distributed environment. In particular, there is a need for dynamic adaptation for provisioned services to accommodate the ever-changing business requirements externally as well as the computing resource status internally, while maintaining the continuousness of service provisioning. We present a dynamic Web service provisioning approach based on .NET common language runtime, one of the two primary Web services platforms, exploring the runtime code manipulation at the intermediate language (IL) level rather than at the source code level. Meanwhile, we show how the service provisioning can be adapted in a modularized way by complementing the conventional service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a repository of adaptation aspects.

A suitable worker is the one who has a high probability of submitting a correct answer for the published HIT. However, there are four problems that make the existing methods be less effective in recommending suitable workers. First, on most of crowdsourcing platforms, the great majority of workers have good reputations and thus are regarded as homogenous workers who have equal opportunities to be recommended. Secondly, dishonest workers may gain recommendations by counterfeiting good reputations and overstating personal skills. Moreover, the classical data sparsity and cold start problems co-exist in crowdsourcing environments. To effectively differentiate homogenous workers, we firstlycalculate a worker\'s performance in different types of HITspublished by different requesters. Aiming to improve the accuracy of predicting a worker\'s performance, we propose a metric which separately considers two requesters\' similarities in transacting with the common workers they trust and in transacting with the common workers they distrust. Afterwards, targeting dishonest behaviours, we propose a transaction-based trust model. Targeting the data sparsity problem, we propose a new trust sub-network extraction algorithm (TSE) to discover more requesters who can provide trustworthy opinions for generating recommendations. Furthermore, we propose two strategiesfor solving the cold start problem.

Ideally, an automatic negotiation process identifies a mutually agreeable policy for both the Web service consumer and provider. WS-Policy defines policy intersection as a \"first approximation\" for determining the compatibility of policies. However, policy intersection has a major weakness: It is a purely syntactic approach neglecting the semantics of the involved policy assertions.

Current methods of service selection usually focus on a single service request at a time and the selection of a service with the best QoS at the user\'s own discretion. The selection does not consider multiple requests for the same functional web services. Usually, there are multiple service requests for the same functional web service in practice. In such situations, conflicts occur when too many requesters select the same best web service. This paper aims at solving these conflicts and developing a global optimal service selection method for multiple related service requesters, thereby optimizing service resources and improving performance of the system. It uses Euclidean distance with weights to measure degree of matching of services based on QoS. A 0-1 integral programming model for maximizing the sum of matching degree is created and consequently, a global optimal service selection algorithm is developed. The model, together with a universal and feasible optimal service selection algorithm, is implemented for global optimal service selection for multiple requesters (GOSSMR).

The tasks of the workflow are associated with functional types for which concrete services can be retrieved from a registry. Abstract tasks have to be mapped to concrete services before the workflow is executed. The goal is to maximize the workflow quality by choosing the right combination of services. Spending more time in discovery and composition will increase the quality of the resulting workflow. Restricted resources motivate however the question about the optimal tradeoff between composition effort and solution quality. In this paper, we aggregate the three phases discovery, composition, and execution into a common cost metric. We motivate why this cost metric may dynamically change depending on the system state and the properties of the workflow at hand.

Most existing web service security models focus on the protection of individual web services. When multiple services from different domains are composed together, it is critical to ensure the proper information flow on the chain of services. In a service chain, each service needs to determine whether the sensitive information can be directly or indirectly disseminated to the subsequent services. Also, each service in the chain needs to decide whether to accept the data passed to it directly or indirectly from prior services. Moreover, the input data that service si receives from si-1, si. InF, may cause certain side effects inside si, such as updating si\'s backend database using data computed from si. InF. Service si may wish to allow such side effects in one situation while reject some side effects in another situation. All these decisions should be made based on the service\'s information flow control policies. To achieve fine-grained information flow control, it is also necessary to analyze the flow and processing of the data and derive the dependencies between the data dynamically generated or used in a service chain. In this paper, we develop a run-time information flow control model for service cloud. First, we develop a run-time dependency analysis mechanism which enables each service in the service chain to determine the correlation between the locally accessed data and the data dynamically generated by the services in the service chain. Then, we develop a model to enable each service in a service chain to specify policies on how its sensitive information can be released to its subsequent services and what types of input data from prior services can be accepted and how they can flow within the services. Finally, we design a run-time protocol to enforce these policies in a service chain.'),(4537,'conf/icws/YeC10','Xinfeng Ye||Yi Chen','A Hybrid Scheme for Controlling Transactional Composite Services.','600-607','2010','conf/icws/2010',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.51','db/conf/icws/icws2010.html#YeC10','Miami, FL','This paper proposes a hybrid concurrency control scheme for transactional composite services.

Instead of using traditional methods, we focus on the similarity and specificity of terms for ontology generation. The amount of domain-specific information included in a term is used to define the specificity of that term. Specific terms are more powerful than general terms for describing a large amount of domain information. Taking advantage of this, we generate a new ontology, which is then used to calculate similarity by defining new logic-based filters. When the similarity calculation fails, we apply information retrieval-based methods. Based on a comprehensive evaluation that we conducted to measure the performance of our method, our novel clustering approach was shown to be more effective in terms of precision, recall, Fmeasure, purity and entropy than other existing clustering approaches.'),(4544,'conf/icws/ZhangLYYLZRB17','Chao Zhang 0010||Baoxian Liu||Junchi Yan||Jinghai Yan||Lingjun Li||Dawei Zhang||Xiaoguang Rui||Rongfang Bie','Hybrid Measurement of Air Quality as a Mobile Service: An Image Based Approach.','853-856','2017','conf/icws/2017',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2017.105','db/conf/icws/icws2017.html#ZhangLYYLZRB17','Honolulu, HI','Air pollution is becoming a serious issue that threatens everyone\'s daily life.

This paper devises an effective web service to address this challenging problem. Specifically we offer a service letting mobile device users to upload photos taken outdoor with meta information. Once the background web service computation is finished, we return the air quality level at their location to the users. In our service system, it includes three basic modules: 1) using GPS location information to get the basic air quality value from the nearest official air quality station, 2) using photo by our air quality assessment based on dictionary learning for image representation to compute air quality. In this method we add ℓ\n<sub>21</sub>\n norm to the target function to promote the nonzero coefficients of the words aggregate within similar quality level, 3) using photo uploaded by user by our CNN based photo air pollution estimation method to obtain the air quality estimation.

QoS factors pose several difficult challenges in how they may be articulated. While the functional requirements of a service can be represented as predicates to be satisfied by the target system, QoS factors are effectively statements of objectives to be maximized or minimized. QoS requirements occur naturally as local specifications of preference. Dealing with QoS factors is therefore a multi-objective optimization problem. In effect, these objectives are never fully satisfied, but satisfied to varying degrees. In evaluating alternative design decisions, we need to trade-off varying degrees of satisfaction of potentially mutually contradictory non-functional requirements. One key contribution of this paper is the use of the constraint hierarchies framework from hierarchical constraint logic programming framework in dealing with quality of service (QoS) factors . We show how QoS factors can be formulated as soft constraints and how the machinery associated with constraint hierarchies can be used to evaluate the alternative trade-offs involved in seeking to satisfy a set of QoS factors that might pull in different directions.

These systems generate an abundance of events, which can be analyzed to diagnose and improve business processes. However, the events are distributed over different data sources, as service-oriented systems are often implemented asWeb services involving different departments in an organization. They need to be consolidated in a process view since it makes no sense to analyze individual events. Existing approaches depend on an explicit case notion to correlate events. They work well on data from process-aware systems (e.g., BPM/WFM systems) which record events explicitly and each event is attached with a case id (a global identifier) to indicate its related process instance. However, most serviceoriented systems (e.g., ERP and CRM) produce object-centric data (e.g., database tables), which record events implicitly (e.g., through redo logs) and separately without a common case id.

In this paper, we propose a novel service discovery approach that considers two key concerns in the discovery domain towards better quality as well as effective service composition. BDA services are fine grained according to the domain and functional behaviors. The services need a domain context-aware and precision-guided discovery approach. Therefore, we propose domain ontology-based service discovery. It is mainly focused on the BDA domain for precise service discovery considering all behavioral signatures between queries and services. As for the second concern, components in composed services depend greatly on each other in situations such as workflow for data analysis. We show that linking services together considering sociability or user preference gives better discovery performance.

It is becoming a trend for system development and integration where systems group functionality around business processes. Although SOA does not require Web services, Web services are based on accepted standards and drive SOA to the mainstream. There are at least two challenges with quality management of SOA based Web service systems. One of them is how to link explicitly its technical capabilities with customerspsila needs to satisfy customerspsila functional and nonfunctional requirements. The second is how to determine targets of Web service technical attributes. The first issue is not addressed at all and the second issue is dealt with subjectively in the current practice of development of SOA based Web service systems. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a major quality management system used to determine product development characteristics from customer requirements. It has found its success in improving quality of complex products, such as automobiles, aircrafts, and consumer electronics, although it has not been used in the development of SOA based Web service systems. In this paper, we analyze a number of quality of Web service requirements and their related technical attributes, and apply the QFD for developing SOA based Web service systems by linking quality of service requirements to Web service design attributes.

The unification of SIP with Web service provides a new converged communication paradigm. It allows dynamic service discovery and binding that integrate SIP as a component in the business transaction. The clear separation of service integration environment and SIP signaling in our approach maintains the simplicity and efficiency of the existing SIP protocol, while leverages the power of both methods in IP based communication services. The ubiquitous service integration nature of Web service provides a disciplined solution to maintain and update large number of SIP endpoints from different installation bases.

The benefit of Infoset is demonstrated first on some dual Web services that provide both REST and SOAP access. The Infoset analysis modeling reveals the commonality and differences between dual Web services, making it feasible to design abstract web services. Infoset also leads to a rule based message processing architecture that avoids the problems in current static Object/XML SOAP engines.

In addition, each concrete service has difficulties in determining QoS that is profitable while attractive for customers, or composite services. Specifically, information on rival services is generally secret and changeable, which is required for the optimal decision. In response to these problems, this paper proposes an algorithm for service selection using Vickrey auction. In the first phase of the proposed algorithm, the composite service selects some best concrete services through the reverse Vickrey auction, only considering the utility function. In the second phase, the global constraints are satisfied through adjustments based on the Vickrey auction.

With more and more candidate services emerging from all over the world, the network delays often greatly impact the performance of the composite service, which are usually not easy to be collected before the composition. One remedy is to predict them for the composition. However, new issues occur in predicting network delay for the composition, including prediction accuracy and on-demand measures to new services, which affect the performance of network-aware composite services. To solve these critical challenges, in this paper, we take advantage of the geographic location information of candidate services. We propose a network-aware QoS (NQoS) model for the composite service. Based on that, we present a novel geographic location-based NQoS prediction approach before composition, and a NQoS re-prediction approach during the execution of the composite service. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real-world dataset collected from PlanetLab.

To eliminate such deficiency, this paper proposes a semi-empirical composition approach which incorporates two stages, i.e., periodical clustering and real-time composition. The former partitions the candidate services and historical requirements into clusters based on similarity measurement, and then the probabilistic correspondences between service clusters and requirement clusters are identified by statistical analysis. The latter deals with a new requirement by firstly finding its most similar requirement cluster and the corresponding service clusters by leveraging Bayesian inference, then a set of concrete services are optimally selected from such reduced solution space and constitute the final composition solution.

Secure and efficient content delivery has long been a requirement of traditional Web-based distribution schemes, and existing Web infrastructure provides numerous options for securing and optimizing HTTP. Two exemplary technologies are SSL/TLS and HTTP compression. While efforts to solidify the more granular WS-Security standards are ongoing, and methods for XML message compression schemes continue to be investigated, HTTP provides an interim solution, supporting transactional security and message compression. The SSL/TLS and HTTP compression technologies have become commoditized and pervasive. And with the trend in content delivery toward hardware offload for these functions, modern data centers have begun to raise the bar for performance. In this paper, we examine three different paradigms for implementing SSL/TLS and HTTP compression: software-based functionality, server-resident hardware accelerators, and centralized network-resident hardware accelerators. We discuss the trade-offs between the two different offload techniques (i.e., PCI accelerator vs. network proxy) and explore their relationship to the current performance activities, in the field of Web services. In analyzing the results for SSL/TLS offload, and the effects of compression, in conjunction with SSL/TLS, we draw parallels with the efforts of WS-Security and XML message compression. Although optimizations for software-based cryptography continues to advance, the potential for hardware-based acceleration should not be overlooked. We discuss our results and address deployment scenarios for optimizing Web-based transactions, and the future optimization of Web Service transactions'),(4584,'conf/icws/CanforaPEV05','Gerardo Canfora||Massimiliano Di Penta||Raffaele Esposito||Maria Luisa Villani','QoS-Aware Replanning of Composite Web Services.','121-129','2005','conf/icws/2005',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57752226','db/conf/icws/icws2005.html#CanforaPEV05','Orlando, FL','Run-time service discovery and late-binding constitute some of the most challenging issues of service-oriented software engineering. For late-binding to be effective in the case of composite services, a QoS-aware composition mechanism is needed. This means determining the set of services that, once composed, not only will perform the required functionality, but also will best contribute to achieve the level of QoS promised in service level agreements (SLAs). However, QoS-aware composition relies on estimated QoS values and workflow execution paths previously obtained using a monitoring mechanism. At run-time, the actual QoS values may deviate from the estimations, or the execution path may not be the one foreseen. These changes could increase the risk of breaking SLAs and obtaining a poor QoS. Such a risk could be avoided by replanning the service bindings of the workflow slice still to be executed. This paper proposes an approach to trigger and perform composite service replanning during execution. An evaluation has been performed simulating execution and replanning on a set of composite service workflows.'),(4585,'conf/icws/LeiD06','Lihui Lei||Zhenhua Duan','Transforming OWL-S Process Model into EDFA for Service Discovery.','137-144','2006','conf/icws/2006',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2006.134','db/conf/icws/icws2006.html#LeiD06','Chicago, IL','Current Web services standards do not well support automatically discovering and selecting services that can be safely integrated with existing components.

As such, one IW application can use an IWOS instance in another IW application. Moreover, non-IW applications (e.g., an online album system) can also access an IWOS instance via its service interface. We further propose a service-oriented framework to manipulate these IWOS instances, to support the transition of these objects mainly between different IW applications, and to enable the transition between IW applications and non-IW applications. Our framework also includes the fundamental services to build hybrid IW applications.

Firstly, the novel construction and processing rules are proposed to guarantee the atomic consistency of the composite service and the correctness of these rules is proved subsequently. Then, on basis of these rules, an Ant Colony System based service selection algorithm is presented to guarantee the end-to-end QoS constraints on the premise of ensuring the atomic consistency during service selection.

We find that 1) many program behaviors cannot be explicitly reflected in the source code, and 2) the relation at code-level is not equivalent to the same functionality. Thus, we propose a functionality-oriented microservice extraction (FoME) method in this study by monitoring program dynamic behavior and clustering execution traces. Instead of source code analysis, the execution traces of a program are applied to group source code entities that are dedicated to the same functionality. We also construct a systematic measurement of microservice by integrating five complementary metrics of service cohesion and coupling. These metrics measure Functional Independence of microservices. That is, it qualifies whether a microservices can have its own responsibilities independently. In the experiment, our method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods on four open-source projects. The microservice candidates generated using our method present similar functional cohesion to the services produced using the other methods, but have considerably looser coupling measurements (dramatically reducing measurements of IRN and OPN).'),(4610,'conf/icws/GomadamRRSV07','Karthik Gomadam||Ajith Ranabahu||Lakshmish Ramaswamy||Amit P.

Although often treated as a composite service, an SBS is proposed from a more practical point of view based on restricted service provisions. In the highly competitive market, just meeting such requirements seems not enough to get more customers for service providers, and they usually provide additional preferential policies, such as a special order \"buy-two-get-one-free\". However, most of current adaptation approaches focus on single transaction, which makes it hard to take full advantage of such preferential policies in reselecting substitutable services. In this paper, we try to make the adaptation decision and reselect services from a broader view, i.e. expand the computation domain from single transaction to the whole lifecycle of an SBS by considering all of the past, current and predicable future executions. We call it \"long-term benefit\" to distinguish benefit in current approaches and propose a long-term benefit driven adaptation approach in this paper. In our approach, services that would bring the max expected long-term benefit would be selected and substituted into current instance in once adaptation. As the long-term benefit is accumulated in several executions, i.e. it depends on a decision sequence, we model the decision making problem as a sequential decision problem, and describe a realization based on partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for maximizing the real income in providing an SBS as an example.'),(4612,'conf/icws/Rinderle-MaRJ09','Stefanie Rinderle-Ma||Manfred Reichert||Martin Jurisch','Equivalence of Web Services in Process-Aware Service Compositions.','501-508','2009','conf/icws/2009',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.72','db/conf/icws/icws2009.html#Rinderle-MaRJ09','Los Angeles, CA','Deciding on Web service equivalence in process-aware service compositions is a crucial challenge throughout the composition life cycle.

To recommend Web services that best fit a user\'s need, QoS values which characterize the non-functional properties of those candidate services are in demand. But in reality, the QoS information of Web service is not easy to obtain, because only limited historical invocation records exist. To tackle this challenge, in recent literature, a number of QoS prediction methods are proposed, but they still demonstrate disadvantages on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we design a location-based hierarchical matrix factorization (HMF) method to perform personalized QoS prediction, whereby effective service recommendation can be made. We cluster users and services into several user-service groups based on their location information, each of which contains a small set of users and services. To better characterize the QoS data, our HMF model is trained in a hierarchical way by using the global QoS matrix as well as several location-based local QoS matrices generated from user-service clusters. Then the missing QoS values can be predicted by compactly combining the results from local matrix factorization and global matrix factorization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a real-world Web service QoS dataset with 1,974,675 real Web service invocation records.

It is of tremendous importance to monitor the services to detect or predict the anomalies timely to avoid QoS violations and Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches. However, monitoring Web services consumes resources and incurs system overhead. It is impractical to constantly monitor all the services in an SBS. Thus, it is a significant challenge to monitor the services of a multi-tenant SBS in a cost-effective manner. In this paper, we propose CM4MTS (Criticality-based Monitoring for Multi-Tenant SBSs) for formulating cost-effective monitoring strategy. The criticality of a service is evaluated based on its impacts on the quality of the SBS upon runtime anomalies and the tenants sharing the service.

Moreover, client side programmers must use the Web service interface specified by the service developer. Therefore, the kinds of applications and uses for a Web service are unnecessarily restrictive, constrained by the granularity of access defined by the interface and by the characteristics of the service functions. This paper describes an approach that addresses both of these drawbacks by enabling Web service containers with the ability to accept new mobile code on the fly, and to run it within the containers, providing direct local access to the containers\' other services. The code can be specified in a small simple language (a subset of C), and translated and passed to the container in a common XML-based intermediate language called X#.

In composite services where data and QoS (modeled in a probabilistic setting) interact, it is difficult to select an atomic service for negotiation, in order to improve end-to-end QoS performance. A superior improvement in one negotiated domain (eg. latency) might mean deterioration in another domain (eg. cost); improvement in one of the invoked services may be annulled by another due to the control flow specified in the orchestration. In this paper, we propose a integer programming formulation based on first order stochastic dominance as a strategy for re-negotiation over multiple services. A consequence of this is better end-to-end performance of the orchestration compared to random selection of services for re-negotiation.

In this paper, we present the first work in providing dynamic analysis as a service using a virtual machine (VM)-based approach on dynamic data race detection. Such a detection needs to track a huge number of events performed by each thread of a program execution of a service component, making such an analysis unsuitable to use message passing to transit huge numbers of events individually.

The coordinator receives the client request, makes the required data transformations and invokes the component Web services as per the specification. However, in certain scenarios businesses might want to impose restrictions on access to the data they provide or the source from which they can accept data. Centralized orchestration can lead to violation of these data flow constraints as the central coordinator has access to the input and output data of all the component Web services. In many cases existing methods of data encryption and authentication are not sufficient to handle such constraints. These data flow constraints, thus, present obstacles for composite Web service orchestration. In this paper we propose a solution for orchestrating composite Web services under data flow constraints. The solution is based on decentralized orchestration, in which a composite Web service is broken into a set of partitions, one partition per component Web service. To overcome data flow constraints, each partition is executed within the same domain as the corresponding component Web service and hence, has the same access rights. However, there are, in general, many ways to decentralize a composite Web service. We apply a rule based filtering mechanism to choose a set of partitions that does not violate the specified dataflow constraints.'),(4647,'conf/icws/CaoZZLL13','Jiuxin Cao||Tao Zhou||Gongrui Zhu||Bo Liu 0004||Junzhou Luo','Execution Recovery in Transactional Composite Service.','276-283','2013','conf/icws/2013',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2013.45','db/conf/icws/icws2013.html#CaoZZLL13','Santa Clara, CA','In the composite service which runs for a long time under the heterogeneous and loose-coupled circumstance, the failure of service tends to occur.

Then, the concepts of execution backup path and switch cost are introduced and a search algorithm is presented to search for the optimal backup path when current service failure occurs.

Our main challenge may be to effectively combine these two kinds of data for service clustering. To address this issue, we propose a new probabilistic generative model which contains two closely connected parts, one characterizing operation community memberships by using operation invocation relationships, and the other characterizing service cluster memberships by utilizing service attributes.

The interactions among the deployed web services are becoming vital to accomplish heterogeneous and compound business goals. Service selection and composition are two common tasks which are highly influenced by the quality of these interactions. Thus, assigning web services QoS-based trust scores that are incrementally updated, provides a means to assist both tasks. Then, services with higher trust scores are more likely to be selected than those with smaller ones. They are, additionally, more prone to be incorporated as part of composite services. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian networks (BN) to learn the composition structure of composite services and compute QoS-based trust scores in an online setting. The learning of the BN structure and parameters is based on modeling the QoS, which is represented by the BN\'s variables, using a multinomial generalized Dirichlet distribution (MGDD). The effectiveness of our approaches is empirically assessed using real and synthetic data. Our experimental results show that MGDD provides a flexible and accurate representation of the QoS.

Since web services are defined by XML- based standards to overcome platform dependency, they are very eligible to integrate with each other in order to establish new services. This composition enables us to reuse existing services, which results in less cost and time consumption. One of the recent problems with web service composition is to maximize the overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the composed service. Most common elements of QoS are response time, availability, reliability, throughput and cost (price). Since the selection of the optimal execution plan that maximizes the composition\'s overall QoS is a NP hard problem, applying optimization techniques is very popular.

In addition, by applying Semantic Web technologies, many research works have been investigated to support automatic service composition.

The underpinning for an organization\'s use of SOC techniques is the ability to discover and compose Web services. Although industry approaches to composition have a strong notion of business processes, these approaches largely use syntactic descriptions. As such composition is limited since the true functionality of ambiguous service operations cannot be inferred. Alternatively, academia uses semantic approaches to disambiguate services, but, at the same time, most of these approaches neglect the process rigor needed for complex compositions. In this paper we present a generalized semantics-based technique for automatic service composition that combines the rigor of process-oriented composition with the descriptiveness of semantics. Our generalized approach extends the common practice of linearly linked services by introducing the use of a conditional directed acyclic graph (DAG) where complex interactions, containing control flow, information flow and pre/post conditions, are effectively represented. Furthermore, the composition can be represented semantically as OWL-S documents.

However, in existing collaborative filtering based service recommendation approaches, the context under which consumers submit a recommendation request is seldom taken into account when filtering similar recommenders and their corresponding experience. In this paper, we propose a new method dubbed CASR (Context-Aware Services Recommendation) by referring to previous service invocation experiences under similar context with the current consumer, which is of great importance in the personalized service recommendation system. First, the proposed algorithm clusters the service invocation records according to the similarity on context properties and selects the cluster that is most similar to the context of current consumer. Then it predicts the QoS of an unused service for current consumer based on the filtered recommendation records by Bayesian inference.

Furthermore, the optimization problem on dynamic resource provision to minimize the operating cost is studied. As the original optimization problem is NPhard, a continuous upper bound is used to convert the original optimization problem into a convex optimization which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time.

Due to the dynamic nature of the service environment, a composite service may not guarantee to deliver an overall optimal QoS. Re-optimization approaches have been developed to handle a dynamic environment. However, these approaches do not consider the diversity of alternative solutions, which may lead to better solutions. In this work, we introduce an adaptive approach, called estimation of distribution algorithm based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine (rEDA). rEDA effectively maintains the diversity of alternative solutions, by leveraging the inference ability of Restricted Boltzmann Machine to capture the potential solutions. It also provides a predictive guidance for the exploration of solution space, by considering the degree of how well a service contributes to the global QoS.

In this paper, we propose a novel service composition algorithm, which models the service composition as multi-domain scheduling problem with minimal service resources and time constraint. Each service is modeled as an exclusive resource during its execution period. By computing the inter-domain communications and available services in each domain, the domain with optimal utilization rate is obtained to arrange services. Meanwhile, loop parallelization is adopted when a service cannot be executed on schedule. Moreover, redundant services of the initial composition are further optimized.

As well, it has the unique requirements on compliance to match existing SOA technologies and characteristics, as simplicity, standardization, high performance, etc. In this paper, a novel context model based SOA policy management framework by innovatively extending W3C Service Modeling Language (SML) and ISO Schematron is introduced.

These environments consist of different distributed analytical and data services, which are composed in a dynamic way to deliver insights that are crucial for stakeholders. Since these environments deal with business critical and sensitive information, strict compliance constraints apply. These constraints lead to situations where certain concrete services are not allowed to exchange data, even though their interaction is necessary to produce the desired results. Finding a valid solution in the space of possible instantiations is a non-trivial problem. In this paper we introduce Nomads, a framework that enables service mobility in such constrained dynamic composition environments to overcome aforementioned restrictions. The framework improves the overall satisfiability and therefore also the quality of constrained DAEs. We outline the requirements of a representative DAE scenario, provide a detailed problem formulation, and then discuss the service mobility framework along with our solution finding algorithm.

This evolution process may have a negative impact on the design quality of Web services. Recent studies addressed the problem of Web service antipatterns detection (bad design practices). To the best of our knowledge, these studies focused only on the use of metrics extracted from the implementation details (source code) of the interface and the services. However, the quality of service (QoS) metrics, widely used to evaluate the overall performance, are never used in the context of Web service antipatterns detection. We start, in this work, from the hypothesis that these bad design practices may impact several QoS metrics such as the response time. Furthermore, the source code metrics of services may not be always available. Without the consideration of these QoS metrics, the current detection processes of antipatterns will still lack the integration of symptoms that could be extracted from the usage of services. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to generate Web service defect detection rules that consider not only the code/interface level metrics but also the quality of service attributes. Through multi-objective optimization, the proposed approach generates solutions (detection rules) that maximize the coverage of antipattern examples and minimize the coverage of well-designed service examples. An empirical validation is performed with eight different common types of Web design defects to evaluate our approach. We compared our results with three other state of the art techniques which are not using QoS metrics. The statistical analysis of the obtained results confirm that our approach outperforms other techniques and generates detection rules that are more meaningful from the services\' user perspective.'),(4741,'conf/icws/WangCFD17','Jiaxing Wang||Bin Cao 0004||Jing Fan||Tianyang Dong','FB-Diff: A Feature Based Difference Detection Algorithm for Process Models.','604-611','2017','conf/icws/2017',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2017.71','db/conf/icws/icws2017.html#WangCFD17','Honolulu, HI','Detecting difference between process models is important for many business process management scenarios, such as process version control and process merging.

As a result, the possible inconsistency failure caused by implicit interactions among concurrent process instances cannot be detected. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach to specify the behavior properties related to shared resources for web service compositions and verify their consistency with the aid of a parametric stateful aspect extension to WS-BPEL. Parameters are introduced in pattern specification, which allows monitoring not only events but also their values bound to the parameters at runtime to keep track of data flow among concurrent process instances.

In this way, dynamic user request workload to a SaaS can be elegantly handled with the rented computing capacity in public cloud. However, although a hybrid cloud may save cost compared with the private cloud, it still introduces considerable renting cost and communication cost. How to optimize such an operational cost becomes one major concern for the SaaS providers to adopt such a hybrid cloud computing paradigm. However, this critical problem remains unanswered in the current state of the art. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the operational cost for the hybrid cloud model by theoretically analyzing the problem with a Lyapunov optimization framework, and accordingly providing an online dynamic provision algorithm. In this way, our approach can address the real-world challenges where no a priori information of public cloud renting prices is available and the future probability distribution of user requests is unknown.

In this paper, we propose an autonomic, workload-aware approach to generate relational schema according to dynamic application characteristics or user specified workload. Our approach adopts the genetic algorithm to find optimal mappings, and an elegant encoding method and related operations are proposed to manipulate mappings using bit strings. We implemented the proposed algorithm and our preliminary experiment results showed that our algorithm was more robust, more suitable for dynamic SOA applications and produced better relational schema than existing work'),(4776,'conf/icws/X06a','','Message from the Program Chairs.',NULL,'2006','conf/icws/2006',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2006.90','db/conf/icws/icws2006.html#X06a','Chicago, IL','Presents the welcome message from the conference proceedings.'),(4777,'conf/icws/AbuJarourO11','Mohammed AbuJarour||Sebastian Oergel','Automatic Sampling of Web Services.','291-298','2011','conf/icws/2011',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.67','db/conf/icws/icws2011.html#AbuJarourO11','Washington DC','With the widespread of Service-oriented Computing (SOC) and the increasing number of available web services in several domains, service discovery has become one of the main challenges in SOC. Lack of rich service descriptions is one of the several factors that exacerbate this challenge. Therefore, additional information about web services is required. Several approaches and sources have been proposed in the community to gather this information, such as domain experts, service providers, service consumers, etc. However, the increasing number of web services requires automatic approaches and additional sources of information. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to generate annotations for web services, e.g., tags, by sampling their automatic invocations. The generated annotations are integrated in web forms that are used for future calls of these web services. Providing correct values for input parameters of web services is one of the main challenges involved in this work. We use four sources to assign values for input parameters, namely, random values, outputs of other operations within the same web service, other web services, and external data sources, e.g., DBpedia, Word Net.

To facilitate such recommendations, existing studies suggest the use of collaborative filtering techniques for personalized QoS prediction. These approaches, by leveraging partially observed QoS values from users, can achieve high accuracy of QoS predictions on the unobserved ones. However, the requirement to collect users\' QoS data likely puts user privacy at risk, thus making them unwilling to contribute their usage data to a Web service recommender system. As a result, privacy becomes a critical challenge in developing practical Web service recommender systems. In this paper, we make the first attempt to cope with the privacy concerns for Web service recommendation. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective privacy-preserving framework by applying data obfuscation techniques, and further develop two representative privacy-preserving QoS prediction approaches under this framework. Evaluation results from a publicly-available QoS dataset of real-world Web services demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our privacy-preserving QoS prediction approaches.

Since services are hosted by service providers, it will be very helpful to predict the tendency of services invocation for service providers, so that proper actions may be taken to ensure the quality of services. Two major challenges exist in predicting the tendency of services invocation, however. First, different service invocation sequences may bear different and complicated characteristics, which is hard to be modeled generally. Second, the intricate relations between service invocation sequences are valuable but hard to be discriminated and utilized. To address these issues, a deep neural network, named Piecewise Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), is developed by taking both generality and pertinence into consideration. For generality, PRNN extracts complicated characteristics of all service invocation sequences through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. For pertinence, PRNN develops a piecewise mechanism, through which service invocation sequences can be clustered automatically and predicted discriminatingly. Extensive experiments in real-world dataset show that PRNN outperforms baseline methods in predicting the tendency of services invocation.'),(4782,'conf/icws/Moreews09','François Moreews','A Framework for Building Reliable Distributed Bioinformatics Service Repositories.','1018-1019','2009','conf/icws/2009',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.143','db/conf/icws/icws2009.html#Moreews09','Los Angeles, CA','The reliability is a major factor that limits the success of promising service oriented architecture in bioinformatics.

High QoS may provide more benefits, but may require a high service price. As a result, the highest QoS may not produce the maximum utility. A service requester and candidate service providers have a conflicting interest over service prices. Since a provider would not reveal its minimum acceptabl price, it is important for a requester to predict the minimum price for a service that meets its QoS requirements.

Reputation has been widely used to measure the trustworthiness of services, and various reputation models for service recommendation have been proposed. Reputation is basically a global trust score obtained by aggregating trust from a community of users, which could be conflicting with an individual\'s personal opinion on the service. Evaluating a service\'s trustworthiness locally based on the evaluating user\'s own or his/her friends\' experiences is sometimes more accurate. However, local trust assessment may fail to work when no trust path from an evaluating user to a target service exists. This paper proposes a hybrid trust-aware service recommendation method for service-oriented environment with social networks via combining global trust and local trust evaluation. A global trust metric and a local trust metric are firstly presented, and then a strategy for combining them to predict the final trust of service is proposed. To evaluate the proposed method\'s performance, we conducted several simulations based on a synthesized dataset.

In dynamic Internet environment, service providers rarely deliver the QoS as declared. Runtime adaptations of execution plans become necessary in order to recovery from web service failures, maintain SLAs, and/or continuously improve the overall QoS attributes. As QoS-aware service composition methods are mainly employed to fulfill runtime adaptations, the time efficiency usually becomes a challenge since the execution of a composite application is blocked until the new execution plan is found. Although existing works have provided high-quality methods to deal with QoS-aware service composition at design time, a suitable mechanism has not been established to utilize these methods coping with runtime adaptations in an efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel empirical approach to accelerate QoS-aware runtime adaptation. Based on historical records, our approach uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to capture the relationship between candidate services and adaptation scenarios which are used at runtime to predict the probabilities that candidate services will be used for upcoming adaptation scenarios. Then candidate services are pruned based on these probability estimates to reduce the search space.

For example, a sub-process (or an activity) can be added, deleted, replaced, skipped, or retried.

However, existing research work mainly focuses on service selection for single request. In fact, with the rapid growth of service users, concurrent requests for the same service are taking place frequently. How to find the global optimal services selection scheme for concurrent requests so as to improve users\' satisfaction and service broker\'s revenue has become a difficult problem. For this issue, this paper firstly transforms the problem of global optimal services selection for concurrent requests to a combinatorial optimization problem, then, it proposes a new evaluation model including admission control operator, users\' satisfaction and service broker\'s revenue evaluation operators, finally, based on two important service domain characteristics(Similarity and Priori), a new Service-Oriented Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (S-ABC) is constructed for solving the global optimal services selection problem.

However, modelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box services remain an open research problem. Software services, such as Web services and Web APIs, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the Internet, thus leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability analysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only on the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g., service workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models become ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by blackbox services, in this paper, we propose CARP, a new contextaware reliability prediction approach, which leverages historical usage data from users to construct context-aware reliability models and further provides online reliability prediction results to users. Through context-aware reliability modelling, CARP is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily limits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches. The preliminary evaluation results show that CARP can make a significant improvement in reliability prediction accuracy, e.g., about 41% in MAE and 38% in RMSE when only 5% of the data are available.'),(4834,'conf/icws/LeeK11','Yong-Ju Lee||Chang-Su Kim','A Learning Ontology Method for RESTful Semantic Web Services.','251-258','2011','conf/icws/2011',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.59','db/conf/icws/icws2011.html#LeeK11','Washington DC','The growing number of RESTful web services available on the web raises a challenging search problem as to how the desired web services should be located.

The main idea consists in identifying the common pattern and differences between SOAP messages, modeled as trees, so as to multicast similar messages together. Our method is based on the well known concept of Tree Edit Distance, built upon a novel filter-differencing architecture to reduce message aggregation time, identifying only those messages which are relevant (i.e., similar enough) for similarity evaluation. In addition, our technique exploits a dedicated differencing output format specifically designed to carry the minimum amount of diff information, in the multicast message, so as to minimize the multicast message size, and therefore reducing the network traffic.

In this paper, we consider a broker that offers a composite service with multiple QoS classes to several users each generating a flow of requests over time.

However, the dynamic and ad hoc nature of mobile computing environments poses a significant challenge for dynamic service composition. In particular, the lack of central control and the potential volatility of service providers increase the complexity and failure probability of the composition process. Although, current research has led to decentralised composition algorithms and failure recovery strategies, the key question of how to reduce the failure probability of a composition still remains. We address this question and propose opportunistic service composition, an optimised execution model for complex service requests.

Users can employ the same interface to invoke various applications from the Internet. For security purposes, service providers would control the access to the provided interface through policy enforcement. Yet the access control of REST interfaces lacks a uniform standard regarding the policy language and corresponding enforcement implementation, which brings two limitations: i) Users have to deal with totally different types of policies to accommodate certain systems. ii) Service providers have to design their own platform-specific authorization policy language and the related enforcement mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a REST Policy Language (RestPL) to express the authorization policies especially for REST APIs. RestPL is ensured to be request-oriented, based on our definition of the standard request form. This indicates that a RestPL policy can be automatically generated from an actual request, which helps mitigate a user\'s pressure during policy designing. Furthermore, we also provide a reference implementation for the enforcement code of RestPL based on regular expressions and deploy it on OpenStack Liberty to demonstrate its feasibility. The experimental results indicate the enforcement overhead of RestPL can be reduced to 80.6% compared with the original policy. In addition, we show that an end-user can also benefit from RestPL for reducing the learning effort by at least 41.6%.'),(4888,'conf/icws/2011','','IEEE International Conference on Web Services, ICWS 2011, Washington, DC, USA, July 4-9, 2011',NULL,'2011',NULL,NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icws/2011/0842/00/index.html','db/conf/icws/icws2011.html','Washington DC',NULL),(4889,'conf/icws/DietzeGD09','Stefan Dietze||Alessio Gugliotta||John Domingue','Exploiting Metrics for Similarity-Based Semantic Web Service Discovery.','327-334','2009','conf/icws/2009',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.26','db/conf/icws/icws2009.html#DietzeGD09','Los Angeles, CA','Semantic Web services (SWS) aim at the automated discovery and orchestration of Web services on the basis of comprehensive, machine-interpretable semantic descriptions.

Hence, semantic level mediation, i.e. mediation between concurrent semantic representations, is a key requirement to allow SWS matchmaking algorithms to compare capabilities of distinct SWS. In that, semantic level mediation requires to identify similarities across distinct SWS representations. Since current approaches to mediate between distinct service annotations rely either on manual one-to-one mappings or on semi-automatic mappings based on the exploitation of linguistic or structural similarities, these are perceived to be costly and error-prone. We propose a mediation approach enabling the implicit representation of similarities across distinct SWS by grounding these in so-called mediation spaces (MS). Given a set of SWS and their respective MS grounding, a general-purpose mediator automatically computes similarities to identify the most appropriate SWS for a given request.

These proposed patterns provide reusable templates to encourage well-defined service evolution while minimizing issues that arise otherwise. They can be applied in the service evolution scenario where a single service is used by many, possibly unknown, consumers\' applications. In such a scenario, providers evolve their services independently from consumers, which might cause unexpected errors and incur unpredicted impact on the dependent consumers\' applications. Therefore, providers can use these patterns to estimate the impact that changes to be introduced to their services may cause on their consumers, and to allow consumers smoothly migrate to the newest version of the service.'),(4901,'conf/icws/LiuL12','Xumin Liu||Hua Liu','Automatic Abstract Service Generation from Web Service Communities.','154-161','2012','conf/icws/2012',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2012.41','db/conf/icws/icws2012.html#LiuL12','Honolulu, HI','The concept of abstract services has been widely adopted in service computing to specify the functionality of certain types of Web services.

However, how to generate abstract services is non-trivial. Current approaches either assume the existence of abstract services or adopt a manual process that demands intensive human intervention. We propose a novel approach to fully automate the generation of abstract services from a service community that consists of a set of functionally similar services. A set of candidate outputs are first discovered based on predefined support ratio, which determines the minimum number of services that produce the outputs. Then, the matching inputs are identified to form the abstract services. We propose a set of heuristics to effectively prune a large number of candidate abstract services.

Recent research has attempted to use role-based approaches to recommend mobile services to other members among the same group in a context dependent manner. However, the traditional role mining approaches originated from the domain of security control tend to be rigid and may not be able to capture human behaviors adequately. In particular, during the course of role mining process, these approaches easily result in over-fitting, i.e., too many roles with slightly different service consumption patterns are found. As a result, they fail to reveal the true common preferences within the user community. This paper proposes an online role mining algorithm with a residual term that automatically group users according to their interests and habits without losing sight of their individual preferences. Moreover, to resolve the over-fitting problem, we relax the role mining mechanism by introducing quasi-roles based on the concept of quasi-bicliques. Most importantly, the new concept allows us to propose a monitoring framework to detect and correct over-fitting in online role mining such that recommendations can be made based on the latest and genuine common preferences.

We attribute this problem to lack of a standard model and language to describe a REST API that respects all the REST constraints. As a result, many web services that claim to be REST API are not hypermedia driven as prescribed by REST. This situation may lead to REST APIs that are not as scalable, extensible, and interoperable as promised by REST. To address this issue, this paper proposes REST Chart as a model and language to design and describe REST API without violating the REST constraints. REST Chart models a REST API as a special type of Colored Petri Net whose topology defines the REST API and whose token markings define the representational state space of user agents using that API. We demonstrate REST Chart with an example REST API. We also show how REST Chart can support efficient content negotiation and reuse hybrid representations to broaden design choices.

According to the orchestration paradigm, the broker coordinates the invocation of services involved in the composition by passing the needed parameters. In general, all previous proposals for the service orchestration model consider the broker as a trusted entity.

As a result, text data services have raised more and more attentions by the research community. Most of such services are implemented based on a content management system such as ElasticSearch and Solr. However, we found that the mere content management capabilities are not enough. On one hand, text data query often requires join operations to relational data or JSON data in an existing DBMS. On the other hand, users often have to pull the big text data out to an independent system or service for further text analytics. In this paper, we present our Text-DataBase-as-a-Service (TDBaaS), which is built on top of the Hybrid Data Service (HDS) from IBM Research. The TDBaaS is designed to manage the text data together with relational data and JSON data in a single service.

Moreover, the extensible framework allows the service to have abundant text analytic capabilities with high performance.

Considering the particularity of scheduling and pricing problems in a service cloud whose goal is generally social welfare maximization, current commonly used models, such as fixed-pricing schemes, have obvious shortcomings and thus are unfeasible. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a randomized mechanism to schedule and charge job executions in service clouds. Our proposed mechanism can schedule jobs in a flexible way to achieve approximate social welfare maximization while guaranteeing non-preemption.

Usually, most of the carbon footprint management systems are based on databases. But database is not sufficient in describing the production and transportation processes and the facilities used in these processes. In this paper, we develop an SOA based model for the carbon footprint management and labeling (CFML), using ontology and OWL-S techniques. We use OWL-S to describe the processes and workflows for production and transportation and extend it to specify the methods for deriving CF of them. We use the existing energy conversion formula to derive the CF when the energy data can be collected separately. We also derive an approach to separate the CFs when data of different processes have to be collected together. In a supply chain, a production company may have different choices of suppliers to provide certain components. To balance the tradeoff between carbon dioxide emission and cost of the overall production process, we design a supplier selection algorithm to derive the optimal solution.'),(4943,'conf/icws/QiDNXML14','Lianyong Qi||Wanchun Dou||Jiancheng Ni||Xiaona Xia||Chunmei Ma||Jinfeng Liu','A Trust Evaluation Method for Cloud Service with Fluctuant QoS and Flexible SLA.','345-352','2014','conf/icws/2014',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2014.57','db/conf/icws/icws2014.html#QiDNXML14','Anchorage, AK','The QoS (quality of service) of a cloud service is not always trusted as advertised, due to the variable network environment or fake advertisement reasons. Therefore, to promote the trusted service selection, we should first evaluate the trust of each cloud service, based on its historical QoS records from past invocations. However, different from the traditional web service whose historical QoS record is a fixed value (e.g., a historical latency record of a web service is 2s), the historical QoS record of a cloud service is usually not fixed, but fluctuant during the long-running period of a single service invocation. For example, an virtual organization O rents cloud service WeatherInquiry between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm so that the employees of O can access WeatherInquiry. In this scenario, the latency of WeatherInquiry is fluctuant from the perspective of organization O, during the served 12 hours. In this situation, it is a challenge to evaluate the trust of service WeatherInquiry, based on WeatherInquiry\'s multiple historical QoS records that fluctuate continuously. In view of this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of flexible SLA, to better accommodate the fluctuant QoS of cloud service, and further put forward a trust evaluation method based on fluctuant QoS and flexible SLA, i.e., FL-FL (FLuctuant QoS-FLexible SLA-based trust evaluation method, FL-FL).

This paper presents a data driven model to analyze transportation mode choice given transportation information. The contributions of this paper lie in the following two aspects. On one hand, we propose a travel mode choice model considering the correlation among influencing features of mode. And the relevant features related to the mode choice are redefined and considered to improve the final efficiency and effectiveness. On the other hand, we propose a directed-graph-guided fused lasso method to depict the correlation rules among features. The lasso method can reduce the redundant information to improve the speed of convergence and accuracy of analysis.

However, predicting the trust between two unknown participants based on the whole large-scale social network can lead to very high computation costs. Thus, prior to trust prediction, extracting a small-scale sub-network containing the important participants and the corresponding contextual information with a high density could make the trust prediction more efficient and effective. However, extracting such a sub-network has been proved to be an NP-Complete problem. To address this challenging problem, we propose a strong social component-aware trust sub-network extraction model, So-BiNet, to search for near-optimal solutions effectively and efficiently. Our method can extract a trust sub-network without any decompression, which can in turn greatly save the search time of trust sub-network extraction. The experiments, conducted on four social network datasets, demonstrate that our approach can efficiently extract sub-networks covering important participants and contextual information while keeping a high density.

For instance, many web services that return schedules, such as bus or train schedules, exhibit this property. We present Differential Caches, with the accompanying Differential Updates method and the Mobile SOAP (MoSOAP) protocol, to avoid transfer of repeated data, sent by a web service to an application. The protocol is flexible in that other optimization techniques, such as encoding, can also be applied. We report on results of experiments, using a research prototype, to evaluate the method\'s potential benefits and also its overhead. The results of experiments show clearly that potential benefits outweigh the overhead.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for service design and composition that combines top-down and bottom-up elements. Our approach is driven by faceted, tag-based functional requirements provided by end-users. These requirements describe, at a high-level, the families of compositions that end-users desire. The requirements kick off a top-down service development lifecycle, where enterprise architects and service developers design, develop and test workflows and services, possibly reusing existing flows and services in the process. At runtime, end-users can specify goals, which are satisfied through a bottom-up composition of flows from the available services. The composed flows include those explicitly designed by the architects as well as new ones that are assembled in a serendipitous manner from the available services.

Given the vast pool of services available today, leading to complex ontologies, the search space becomes extremely large, increasing the complexity of the search. We construct an overlay reflecting the relationships between the services, which facilitates the pruning of the entire search space. Additionally our system takes into consideration the user context which provides information pertaining to the users preferences.

Our experiments show that CCD significantly improves the scalability of the search by aggressively pruning the search space, achieved by visiting only relevant nodes.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a Web service positioning (WSP)framework for response time prediction, which is one of the most important QoS properties. In our approach, a small set of landmarks are deployed to periodically monitor the response times of the Web service candidates and provide references to the numerous service users. By combining the advantages of network coordinate based approaches and collaborative filtering based approaches, the response times between users and Web services can be accurately predicted using their corresponding Euclidean distances.

One of the popular representations is mashup. It is a new application created by combining different kinds of services. There exist multiple typed objects (e.g., mashup, service, category, tag, provider and description) and relations (e.g., compose and composed by relation between mashups and services, provide and provided by relation between services and providers), which constitute a heterogeneous information network (HIN) naturally. Several approaches already exist for recommending services for users but they are limited to consider only one or two kinds of relations between mashups and services. To apply the rich semantics and enhance recommendation performance, in this paper, we propose a Factorization Machine based service Recommendation approach, called FMRec, on HIN. Specifically, we firstly apply counting-based similarities for meta paths to capture the multiple semantic meanings between mashups and services. And then, we employ matrix factorization to the similarity matrices built by different kinds of meta paths to obtain the mashup latent features and service latent features. Finally, we leverage factorization machine model with a group lasso regularization term to learn the ratings between mashups and services. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset, indicating that our proposed service recommendation approach significantly improves the quality of the recommendation results compared with existing methods.'),(4967,'conf/icws/OuzzaniB03','Mourad Ouzzani||Athman Bouguettaya','A Query Paradigm for Web Services.','152-155','2003','conf/icws/2003',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,NULL,'db/conf/icws/icws2003.html#OuzzaniB03','Las Vegas, NV',NULL),(4968,'conf/icws/0001C15','Li Li 0001||Wu Chou','Designing Large Scale REST APIs Based on REST Chart.','631-638','2015','conf/icws/2015',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.89','db/conf/icws/icws2015.html#0001C15','New York, NY','REST Chart is a Petri-Net based XML modeling framework for REST API. This paper presents two important enhancements and extensions to REST Chart modeling - Hyperlink Decoration and Hierarchical REST Chart. In particular, the proposed Hyperlink Decoration decomposes resource connections from resource representation, such that hyperlinks can be defined independently of schemas. This allows a Navigation-First Design by which the important global connections of a REST API can be designed first and reused before the local resource representations are implemented and specified. Hierarchical REST Chart is a powerful mechanism to rapidly decompose and extend a REST API in several dimensions based on Hyperlink Decoration. These new mechanisms can be used to manage the complexities in large scale REST APIs that undergo frequent changes as in some large scale open source development projects. This paper shows that these new capabilities can fit nicely in the REST Chart XML with very minor syntax changes. These enhancements to REST Chart are applied successfully in designing and verifying REST APIs for software-defined-networking (SDN) and Cloud computing.'),(4969,'conf/icws/LeitnerMRD10','Philipp Leitner||Anton Michlmayr||Florian Rosenberg||Schahram Dustdar','Monitoring, Prediction and Prevention of SLA Violations in Composite Services.','369-376','2010','conf/icws/2010',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60485572','db/conf/icws/icws2010.html#LeitnerMRD10','Miami, FL','We propose the PREvent framework, which is a system that integrates event-based monitoring, prediction of SLA violations using machine learning techniques, and automated runtime prevention of those violations by triggering adaptation actions in service compositions.

Specifically, we transform the original app rating matrix to feature rating data and predict the unknown ratings on the features through a latent factor model, instead of directly predicting ratings on apps. The predicted user ratings on features can be used to generate the ratings on apps. Two integration methods are presented to give different significance for feature preferences. The approach has some obvious advantages: as it integrates feature information to analyze the details of user preference, it can generalize better as the feature rating data is denser, and improve the interpretation of the prediction of app ratings.

Such architectures, however, also bring about their own security challenges that require due consideration. Unfortunately, the current information security mechanisms are insufficient to address these challenges. In particular, the access control models today are mostly static and coarsely grained; they are not well-suited for the service-oriented environments where information access is dynamic and ad-hoc in nature. This paper outlines the access control challenges for Web services and SOA, and proposes an attribute based access control (ABAC) model as a new approach, which is based on subject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. The paper describes the ABAC model in terms of its authorization architecture and policy formulation, and makes a detailed comparison between ABAC and traditional role-based models, which clearly shows the advantages of ABAC. The paper then describes how this new model can be applied to securing Web service invocations, with an implementation based on standard protocols and open-source tools.

As QoS is an aggregated concept consisting of several attributes, service composition on enormous candidate sets is a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, we study the problem from a general Pareto-optimal angle, seeking to reduce the search space in service composition. QoS attributes are systematically studied according to their different types of aggregation pattern in service composition, and QoS-based dominance relationships between candidates and between workflows are defined. Taking advantage of pruning candidates by dominance relationships and constraint validations at candidate level, a service composition algorithm using partial selection technique is proposed, which is able to significantly reduce the search space and achieve great performance gains.

Though these parameters are crucial for selecting web services, they do not reflect the end-user\'s perspective on quality. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adopting the perceived quality from end-user\'s perspective for service selection and composition.

However, growing with the data scale and integration of multiprocessors in the cloud computing environment, each processor has to obtain the global lock of the system run queue, which brings inevitable burden for the runtime support. In this paper, we propose a novel lock free structure, named FairPlay, which is able to support service migration through duplex buffers between processors.

QoS rankings provide valuable information for making optimal service selection and recommendation from a set of functionally similar or equivalent service candidates. However, in order to obtain such rankings, a huge number of invocations on the services are usually required, which is extremely expensive and even impractical in reality. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a scheme to derive the global ranking from observations of QoS rankings on subsets of the services, while the observations may also be contaminated by noise and errors.

However, ABC was initially designed for numerical optimization, and its effectiveness highly depends on what we call optimality continuity property of the solution space, i.e., similar variable values (or neighboring solutions) result in similar objective values (or evaluation results). We will show that SSP does not possess such property. We further propose an approximation approach based on greedy search strategies for ABC, to overcome this problem. In this approach, neighboring solutions are generated for a composition greedily based on the neighboring services of its component services. Two algorithms with different neighborhood measures are presented based on this approach. The resulting neighborhood structure of the proposed algorithms is analogical to that of continuous functions, so that the advantages of ABC can be fully leveraged in solving SSP. Also, they are pure online algorithms which are as simple as canonical ABC. The rationale of the proposed approach is discussed and the complexity of the algorithms is analyzed.

We also develop a proportional revenue division rule to incentivize elementary service providers to contribute in improving the QoS of the final composite service delivered to end users. Concerning privacy conservation, we develop a decentralized and recursive bidding algorithm, allowing service providers to reach an equilibrium without disclosing their private information.

More specifically, with the shared modeling workspace, business process models can be developed, refined and shared. Within the shared execution environment, a business process model is translated into a WS-BPEL based executable model, which is then assigned for execution in a virtual machine container from a shared machine cluster.

Global operations, outsourcing, and increasing specialization have all contributed to this trend. One challenge facing the extended enterprise is how to reconnect the information flows and business processes that were disconnected as the enterprise disaggregated. The emergence of web services, service-oriented architectures, and business process modeling and execution standards are helping to address this challenge. Our contention is that the next phase of evolution is the rise of the intelligent enterprise, which is characterized by being able to adapt quickly to changes in its operating environment. The intelligent enterprise monitors its own business processes and its interactions with customers, partners, suppliers, and collaborators; it understands how this information relates to its business objectives; and it acts to control and optimize its operations to meet its business objectives. Decisions are made quickly and accurately to modify business processes on the fly, dynamically allocate resources, or change business partners (e.g., suppliers, service providers) and partnerships (e.g., establish new service level agreements).

Furthermore, most of the disambiguated data is embedded within the search engines of the scholarly databases, and existing application programming interfaces (APIs) have limited features and are often unavailable for users for various reasons. This makes it difficult for researchers and developers to use the data for various applications (e.g. author search) or research. Here, we design a novel, web-based, RESTful API for searching disambiguated authors, using the PubMed database as a sample application. We offer two type of queries, attribute-based queries and record-based queries which serve different purposes. Attribute-based queries retrieve authors with the attributes available in the database. We study different search engines to find the most appropriate one for processing attribute-based queries. Record-based queries retrieve authors that are most likely to have written a query publication provided by a user.

These failures result in incidents that product vendors service as a part of the warranty or contracts. Incidents incur significant costs for servicing them, including call centers, parts, and field engineers. Some of the major problems include lack of coherent incident information, leading to inaccurate service diagnosis and inability to forecast failures. At the same time, technology has evolved. Hardware is generally more reliable, failures are moving from hardware to firmware, software, and applications. The scale effect limits human operator engagement, prevents centralized approaches, and expands automation. Traditional ways of handling incidents are not appropriate any more. In this paper we present a set of tools and approaches that enable unified serviceability with self-healing, automated learning, and an analysis engine. Unified serviceability with self-healing results in clean incident data and it reduces criticality of incidents into deferred maintenance. Automated learning produces empirically proven actionable knowledge enabling cost reduction of automated incident resolution. Using clean data and actionable knowledge, the analysis engine helps predict failures and determine trends, resulting in preventive maintenance.

Basically, the technique uses regression models for estimating the unknown reputation values of newcomer services from their known values of QoS attributes.

In the existing work of improving data availability in DOSN, it is often assumed that the friends of a user are always capable of contributing sufficient storage capacity to store all the data published by the user. However, this assumption is not always true for today\'s Online Social Networks (OSNs) for the following reasons. On one hand, the increasingly more data are being generated on the OSNs nowadays. On the other hand, current users often use the smart mobile devices to access the OSNs. These two factors cause the shortage of the storage capacity in DOSN, where the published data are supposed to be stored within a friend circle. The limitation of the storage capacity may jeopardize the data availability. Therefore, it is desired to know the relation between the storage capacity contributed by the OSN users and the level of data availability that the OSN can achieve. This paper addresses this issue. In this paper, the data availability model over storage capacity is established. Further, a novel method is proposed to predict the data availability on the fly. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the data availability model and the on-the-fly prediction. The data availability model can be used by the OSN designers to determine the storage capacity for the published data in order to achieve the desired data availability. The on-the-fly prediction method can help the data replication and storage policies make judicious decisions at runtime.'),(5111,'conf/icws/JiaMCYT14','Changjiang Jia||Lijun Mei||Wing Kwong Chan||Yuen-Tak Yu||T.

In this paper, we examine whether such a factor or technique may consistently affect the rate of fault detection in both the average and adverse scenarios. The factors studied include prioritization strategy, artifacts to provide coverage data, ordering direction of a strategy, and the use of executable and non-executable artifacts.

The key challenges for such monitoring services are characterized by the combination of spatial and non-spatial attributes being monitored and the wide spectrum of update rates. A typical example of such services is \"alert me when the gas price at a gas station within 5 miles of my current location drops to 4 per gallon\". Such a service needs to monitor the gas price changes in conjunction with the highly dynamic nature of location information. Scalability of such location sensitive and content rich information monitoring services in the presence of different update rates and monitoring thresholds poses a big technical challenge. In this paper, we present SLIM, a scalable location sensitive information monitoring service framework with two unique features. First, we make intelligent use of the correlation between spatial and non-spatial attributes involved in the information monitoring service requests to devise a highly scalable distributed spatial trigger evaluation engine. Second, we introduce single and multi-dimensional safe value containment techniques to efficiently perform selective distributed processing of spatial triggers to reduce the amount of unnecessary trigger evaluations.

In this work, we simplify the privilege partitioning problem into a classification problem of RESTful functions, so the permission to call a category of functions can be granted to a specific administrator. We propose a RESTful API classification approach called RestSep based on genetic algorithm. A classification is represented as a 2-dimensional matrix, which is used as the chromosome. Customized operators of selection, mutation and crossover are designed. The fitness function is designed to balance parameters such as number of categories, test case coverage, function overlapping, etc. Experiments on popular clouds like OpenStack and Kubernetes indicate RestSep can generate a self-explanatory classification result, which can serve as a guideline for privilege partitioning.

In order to adapt the ant colony system to handle the dynamic scenarios, several pheromone modification strategies in reaction to changes of the optimization scenarios are investigated. The aim of the strategies is to find a balance between preserving enough old pheromone information to speed up the search process, and resetting enough new pheromone information to facilitate the ants to find a new solution for the changed scenarios.

Data-centric property is enforced at runtime by blocking the process whose next action would violate it. The impacted processes can be unblocked and allowed to execute when the specified property eventually reaches a safe state. EnforceBCL also provides the mechanism to detect possible deadlock during the enforcement of the property, and executes corresponding handler to solve the deadlock.

However, the network extraction has been proved to be NP-Complete. Towards solving this challenging problem, we first propose a complex contextual social network structure which considers some social contexts, having significant influences on both social interactions and trust evaluation between participants.

These user responses are analyzed to determine if they were indeed naturally produced, and transcribed to ensure that they contain the challenge sentence. We build a prototype for vCAPTCHA in order to assess its performance and practicality.

A business process is a collection of related structures and activities, undertaken by organizations in order to achieve certain business goals. The Web services-based business processes with a new set of protocols bring a new set of security challenges. As security has become an essential component for all software, several security solutions for XML and Web services have been proposed. In general, a security threat model is an organized representation of relevant threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities to a system. In this context, security threat modeling is an engineering technique which can be used to shape the Web service-based business processes with security requirements. The topic of security threat modeling in business process is becoming increasingly important to industry. This tutorial strives to reflect recent trends in research and developments of business processes integration and management with security concerns. In addition this tutorial will cover the fundamental concepts of security threat modeling from the perspectives of Web service-based business process.

These two type of checking are based on the services descriptions. Enriching services descriptions by including their behaviours is becoming more and more important.

Service discovery is one of these technologies that can help identify the desired IoT devices for the given task. In this paper, we design an efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) service discovery algorithm in an IoT network with a mix of static and mobile IoT nodes. Our algorithm is based on unstructured p2p routing with routing information caching (RIC). Due to the limited memory on IoT nodes, we bound the cache size to fit the IoT nodes and maximize the usefulness of their RIC content. First, we build an ontology of IoT device capabilities and design a hierarchical Bloom-filter based Indexing (HBFI) to index the capabilities in the ontology. HBFI is flexible in incorporating new capabilities and offers much more space efficient representation of the routing information. Also, the cache replacement scheme of RIC considers the reference time of the entries (as conventional), the mobility of the IoT nodes, and the inclusiveness of the capability concept. Experimental evaluations show that with the same memory size constraint, our scheme can provide more effective routing information and minimize the service discovery time compared to centralized, supernode based, DHT based, flooding based, and other information caching based solutions.'),(5153,'conf/icws/MonsieurSL07','Geert Monsieur||Monique Snoeck||Wilfried Lemahieu','CoordinatedWeb Services Orchestration.','775-783','2007','conf/icws/2007',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q61039940','db/conf/icws/icws2007.html#MonsieurSL07','Salt Lake City, UT','In a business process execution language (BPEL) process definition the sequence of exchanged messages typically originates from the sequence of business process activities and from the need of coordination of those activities across the participants of the process.

First, context-based mashup schemas with probability are extracted and recovered by applying pattern mining tasks to historical mashup logs. Then, according to user goal and awareness of user context, an optimal mashup schema is composed progressively by top-k recommendations for the next behavior/activity, which will be grounded to Web-API based components later.

However, current approaches for web services composition and execution, such as WS-BPEL, can neither tailor the execution automatically as per the required QoS nor can they adapt to the highly dynamic environment. Though there have been some recent efforts in this direction they are piecemeal and insufficient. They either do not take user\'s non-functional requirements (NFRs) into consideration for adaptation, or there is no standard way of specifying these requirements for a BPEL process. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for dynamically adapting web service compositions based on NFRs. We first give a specification for representing NFRs for each partner service of a BPEL process, and then describe a system that dynamically adapts the BPEL process based on these requirements by selecting suitable services at runtime. The selected services only need to be semantically equivalent and the system automatically takes care of the syntactical differences between their interfaces. We integrated our system in an existing BPEL engine using aspect oriented approach and demonstrate via experiments that it has very little performance overhead even at high loads.'),(5166,'conf/icws/ZhengB07','George Zheng||Athman Bouguettaya','A Web Service Mining Framework.','1096-1103','2007','conf/icws/2007',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2007.27','db/conf/icws/icws2007.html#ZhengB07','Salt Lake City, UT','We propose a service mining framework for exploring interesting compositions of existing Web services.

Previous work in Web service selection usually assumes the invocations of Web service operations to be independent of one another. This assumption however does not hold in practice as both the composite and component Web services often impose some orderings on the invocation of their operations. Such orderings constrain the selection of component Web services to orchestrate the composite Web service. We therefore propose to use finite state machine (FSM) to model the invocation order of Web service operations. We define a measure, called aggregated reliability, to measure the probability that a given state in the composite Web service will lead to successful execution in the context where each component Web service may fail with some probability. We show that the computation of aggregated reliabilities is equivalent to eigenvector computation. The power method is hence adopted to efficiently derive aggregated reliabilities. In orchestrating a composite Web service, we propose two strategies to select component Web services that are likely to successfully complete the execution of a given sequence of operations. Our experiments on a synthetically generated set of Web service operation execution sequences show that our proposed strategies perform better than the baseline random selection strategy.'),(5168,'conf/icws/Luo08','Min Luo','Common Business Components and Services toward More Agile and Flexible Industry Solutions and Assets.','9-10','2008','conf/icws/2008',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.147','db/conf/icws/icws2008.html#Luo08','Beijing, China','In many decades, many organizations, especially large consulting companies, have been designing, implementing and managing business solutions for every industry around the globe.

Therefore, reuse and more importantly, managing the ever changing business requirements, become almost impossible. Service-orientation and architecture, model-driven business development provides us a new and powerful approach to facilitate asset based industry solution design and development. To further accelerate this, this tutorial will discuss an innovative approach that take advantage of many proven best software engineering practices, from object/component based technology, meta-data driven architecture types (archetypes) that are used to model the common structural and in some cases non-structural business entities such as customer, product, payment, etc. In order to address the consequences introduced by abstracting those common elements out of the specific industry model and be able to enable easy and meta-data based transformation, we properly decompose business components/services into a multi-layered business architecture. Therefore, process/components/services can be decomposed accordingly to facilitate the decomposition and abstraction, while maintaining certain level of necessary traceability across various artifacts. In the realization phase, existing assets/operational systems will be mapped and transformed to the required business components and services to best leverage those existing valuable industry/client investments.

However, traditional RL methods cannot guarantee good efficiency for large-scale composition problems. Hierarchical RL (HRL) has appeared to be a viable solution to address the efficiency issue. The applicability of existing HRL methods (e.g., MAXQ) requires a task graph, which can be generated by decomposing a composition plan into a task hierarchy. Current approaches that apply HRL to service composition generate the task graph manually, which will not scale to large service composition problems.

While providers concentrate more on the technical levels of activation and communication within a service network, the users, i.e. the service consumers, want to form ad-hoc collaborations between Web services. To shield users of Web services from the technical details of finding and combining them, a semantic level has to be found that suits their specific needs and expertise. Through a semantic layer, WS Talk tries to create a level of abstraction that enables views on services expressed in natural language. To reduce the complexity of natural language, domain-specific languages are defined and their semantics are mapped onto Web services and their attributes.

This leads to the general optimization problem of how to select Web services for each task so that the overall QoS and cost requirements of the composition are satisfied. Current proposals use exact algorithms or complex heuristics (e.g. genetic algorithms) to solve this problem. An actual implementation of a workflow engine (like our WSQoSX architecture), however, has to be able to solve these optimization problems in real-time and under heavy load. Therefore, we present a heuristic that performs extremely well while providing excellent (almost optimal) solutions. Using simulations, we show that in most cases our heuristic is able to calculate solutions that come as close as 99% to the optimal solution while taking less than 2% of the time of a standard exact algorithm.

In this paper, we present an effective personalized collaborative filtering method for Web service recommendation. A key component of Web service recommendation techniques is computation of similarity measurement of Web services. Different from the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) similarity measurement, we take into account the personalized influence of services when computing similarity measurement between users and personalized influence of services. Based on the similarity measurement model of Web services, we develop an effective Personalized Hybrid Collaborative Filtering (PHCF) technique by integrating personalized user-based algorithm and personalized item-based algorithm. We conduct series of experiments based on real Web service QoS dataset WSRec [11] which contains more than 1.5 millions test results of 150 service users in different countries on 100 publicly available Web services located all over the world.

Wi-Fi data offloading overcomes the aforementioned issues for delay-tolerant data, at the cost of constrained mobility for users as they are required to stay within a given area while the data is uploaded. The up-link of the broadband connection of the access point is a bottleneck and incurs significant waiting times. In this paper, we advocate the exploitation of the storage capabilities of common devices located on the Wi-Fi access point LAN, typically residential gateways, to decrease the waiting time. We propose Hoop, a system for offloading upload tasks onto such devices. Hoop operates seamlessly on HTTP(S) POSTs, making it highly generic, it also requires limited changes on the gateways and on the web server and none to existing protocols or browsers. Hoop is secure and, in a typical setting, reduces the waiting time by up to a factor of 46. By correlating mobility traces with the positions of the Wi-Fi access points of a major community network, we show that Hoop drastically decreases the delay between the time a photo is taken and the time it is uploaded, compared to regular Wi-Fi offloading.'),(5196,'conf/icws/CruzMZC12','Sérgio Manuel Serra da Cruz||Laci Mary B.

PageRank is a representative example of such algorithms, which was first utilized in the Google search engine in 1998. However, the PageRank approach merely assumes a single link as a vote, which allows one originator to link or transfer his work to others more than once in a handover work scenario.

Also, it suffers from the limited observability problem which is not uncommon in web services. Despite its optimality, the traversal algorithm does not take advantages of the special patterns in web service interfaces observed by developers.

We present AppReco, a systematic recommendation system of iOS mobile applications that can evaluate mobile applications without executions. AppReco evaluates apps that have similar interests with static binary analysis, revealing their behaviors according to the embedded functions in the executable. The analysis consists of three stages: (1) unsupervised learning on app descriptions with Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic discovery and Growing Hierarchical Self-organizing Maps for hierarchical clustering, (2) static binary analysis on executables to discover embedded system calls and (3) ranking common-topic applications from their matched behavior patterns. To find apps that have similar interests, AppReco discovers (unsupervised) topics in official descriptions and clusters apps that have common topics as similar-interest apps. To evaluate apps, AppReco adopts static binary analysis on their executables to count invoked system calls and reveal embedded functions. To recommend apps, AppReco analyzes similar-interest apps with their behaviors of executables, and recommend apps that have less sensitive behaviors such as commercial advertisements, privacy information access, and internet connections, to users. We report our analysis against thousands of iOS apps in the Apple app store including most of the listed top 200 applications in each category.'),(5214,'conf/icws/LeffR17','Avraham Leff||James T.

Network timeouts introduce uncertainty about the success or failure of a given API call: in certain scenarios, simply retrying the operation may make the situation worse. In order to guarantee pseudo-atomicity of a web-service call sequence, the failure of one API call implies that other, successfully completed, API calls may have to compensated for before retrying the original set of web-service calls. Even if no failure occurs, orchestration of a web-service to deal with edge-cases (such as expiration of credentials) can be difficult to implement correctly. In this paper we describe an approach to solving such scenarios which we have implemented in our WSO project.

OSNs contain important participants, the trust relations between participants, and the contexts in which participants interact with each other. All of these have a great influence on the prediction of the trust between a source participant and a target participant, which is important for a participant\'s decision-making process in many applications, such as seeking service providers. However, predicting the trust from a source participant to a target one based on the whole social network is not really feasible. Thus, prior to trust prediction, the extraction of a small-scale sub-network containing most of the important nodes and contextual information with a high density rate could make trust prediction more efficient and effective. However, extracting such a sub-network has been proved to be an NP-Complete problem. To address this challenging problem, we propose BiNet: a social context-aware trust sub-network extraction model to search for near-optimal solutions effectively and efficiently. In this model, we first capture important factors that affect the trust between participants in OSNs. Next, we define a utility function to measure the trust factors of each node in a social network. At last, we design a novel binary ant colony algorithm with newly designed initialization and mutation processes for sub-network extraction incorporating the utility function. The experiments, conducted on two popular datasets of Epinion and Slash dot, demonstrate that our approach can extract sub-networks covering important participants and contextual information while keeping a high density rate. Our approach is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the quality of extracted sub-networks within the same execution time.'),(5217,'conf/icws/LiL11','Yin Li||Chuang Lin','QoS-Aware Service Composition for Work?ow-Based Data-Intensive Applications.','452-459','2011','conf/icws/2011',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2011.18','db/conf/icws/icws2011.html#LiL11','Washington DC','Web service composition can make use of distributed services with various functions to accomplish a specific task.

In particular, there exist coarse-grained metrics of cohesion lack, which consider that the operations of a service interface are related if the types of certain of their input/output data exactly match. The problem in this approach is that operations which operate on data characterized by similar, but not exactly matching, types are treated as being totally unrelated. Consequently, the aforementioned metrics may overestimate the cohesion lack of service interfaces.

In the literature, the need of knowledge enrichment has been recognized as the key to the success of semantic search. However, previous work of automatic knowledge extraction, such as Google Knowledge Vault, aim at identifying the unannotated knowledge triples from the full web-scale content in the offline execution. In our study, we show that most people demand the updated knowledge soon after the information is announced. However, the number of queries of such knowledge dramatically declines after a few days, meaning that the most people cannot obtain the precise knowledge from the execution of the offline knowledge enrichment when they inquire the answer of the timely events. To remedy this, we propose the SCKE framework to extract new knowledge triples which can be executed in the online scenario.

Our research was motivated by the identification of abstract nonfunctional properties (NFPs) for a seamless ASC and proposes transformation from the abstract NFPs to intermediate-level NFPs based on the model of three levels of abstractness of NFPs. To solve the vagueness of the abstractness, we adapt approaches based not only on ontology but also on term similarity. The transformation between the intermediate and the concrete levels is carried out by a deterministic algorithm based on mapping of domain ontology.

An experienced user is able to be more active in providing configuration information such as expected boundary of a QoS property, distribution function of user satisfaction, and the aggregation weight of each QoS property. While a novice user has limited experience to do this. Based on the study of user-centered factors in QoS computation, we propose a user-centered QoS computation, which provides a new choice of normalization in property value preprocessing aspect, an approach of approximation in user satisfaction calculation aspect, and a weight suggestion way in aggregation of multiple properties aspect.

This talk provides a survey of key developments that work towards this ambitious goal. The fundamental work in this area has centered on three models, each coming with a different approach to the composition problem. The OWL-S model for Web services focuses on how Web services interact with the \"real world,\" represented abstractly using (time-varying) first-order logic predicates and terms. A representative composition result here uses a translation into Petri nets. The \"Roman\" model for services focuses on an abstract notion of \"activities\" (without modeling how they impact the world), and in essence model Web services as finite state automata with transitions labeled by these activities. A powerful composition result is obtained using a reduction to propositional dynamic logic (PDL). The conversation model focuses on messages passed between Web services, and again uses finite state automata to model the internal processing of a service, with transitions labeled by message sends and message reads. A key result here concerns determination of the \"local\" behavior of individual services, if they are required to conform to a given \"global\" behavior. The talk also discusses two ongoing efforts to unify the three models just described. One activity, by the semantic Web services intiative (SWSI), is to develop a semantic Web services ontology (SWSO).

Among the challenges, the storage and computing required by big data analytics is usually huge, and as a result big data capabilities are often provisioned in cloud and delivered in the form of Web-based services. Solid-state drive (SSD) is widely used nowadays as an elementary hardware feature in cloud infrastructure for big data services. For example, Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers EC2 instances with SSD storage, and its key-value data store, DynamoDB, is backed up by SSD for superior performance. Compared to hard disk drive (HDD), SSD prevails in both access latency and bandwidth. In the foreseeable future, SSD would be readily available on commodity servers though its capacity would be neither large enough nor cost effective to accommodate big data on its own. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to efficiently leverage SSD as one layer in a storage hierarchy in addition to HDD. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using SSD in three workloads, namely standalone Hadoop MapReduce jobs, Hive jobs, and HBase queries. Firstly, we device an approach to enable Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) having a SSD-HDD storage hierarchy. Secondly, we investigate the IO involved in different phases of Hadoop jobs and design different schemes to place data discriminatively in the aforementioned storage hierarchy. Afterward, the effectiveness of different schemes are evaluated with respect to job run time. Finally, we summarize best practices of data placement for examined workloads in a SSD-HDD storage hierarchy.'),(5273,'conf/icws/PantazoglouTAP06','Michael Pantazoglou||Aphrodite Tsalgatidou||George Athanasopoulos||Thomi Pilioura','A Unified Approach for the Discovery of Web and Peer-to-Peer Services.','901-902','2006','conf/icws/2006',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2006.19','db/conf/icws/icws2006.html#PantazoglouTAP06','Chicago, IL','As the Web service technology matures, other computing paradigms such as peer-to-peer gradually adopt the service-oriented approach and are beginning to expose functionality as services.

Designing messages dynamic granularity (offloading) is a key challenge for achieving good performances. This requires the server being able to predict the pieces of data actually used by clients in order to send only such data. However, exact prediction is not easy, and consequently lazy interactions are needed to transfer additional data whenever the prediction fails. To preserve semantics, lazy accesses to the results of a Web service interaction need to work on a dedicated copy of the business object stored as application state. Thus, dynamic offloading can experience an overhead due to a prediction failure, which is the sum of round-trip and storage access delays, which could compromise the benefits of the technique. This paper improves our previous work enabling dynamic offloading for both IN and OUT parameters, and analyses how attributes copies impact on the technique, by comparing the overheads introduced by different storage technologies in a real implementation of a Web services framework that extends CXF. More specifically, we quantitatively characterize the execution contexts that make dynamic offloading effective, and the expected accuracy of the predictive strategy to have a gain in term of response time compared to plain services invocations.

We take a dual perspective wherein business processes are modeled as compositions of (instantiated) business protocols. Each business protocol specifies interactions among its partners; each protocol serves a unique business purpose, e.g., processing a payment or shipping an item. Thus, modularizing a monolithic business process via business protocols allows clear separation of concerns for modeling and enacting the process. We develop an approach in which protocols are compiled into local skeletal flows for each participant that can be fleshed out with local business logic as needed.

The functional scenarios represent the service\'s core functionality, while the adaptation scenarios capture the service\'s runtime adaptation in response to context changes. The service properties that need to hold at runtime are also represented graphically in a form similar to the scenarios. Second, a technique is introduced to enumerate and generate the specifications of a service\'s variants from its scenarios. The generated variants are then validated against the service properties to ensure their validity. This technique also checks the consistency of the service\'s adaptation requirements (scenarios).

First, a graph compression based social network model, namely agglomerative graph, is introduced, which is a lossless compression to the original network. Then, inspired by the idea of iteration based on the selected seeds, the algorithm expands the selected seeds to the communities by optimizing the proposed community fitness function iteratively. Finally, it merges the communities of high similarity with each other to get the final results. Since the network is lossless compressed, and massive redundant computations are avoided, the results can be exactly obtained in an efficient and effective way.

One fundamental research issue at this intersection is the storage of the resource description framework (RDF) data: the model at the core of the semantic Web. We present a data-centric approach for storage of RDF in relational databases. The intuition behind our approach is that each RDF dataset requires a tailored table schema that achieves efficient query processing by (1) reducing the need for joins in the query plan and (2) keeping null storage below a given threshold. Using a basic structure derived from the RDF data, we propose a two-phase algorithm involving clustering and partitioning. The clustering phase aims to reduce the need for joins in a query. The partitioning phase aims to optimize storage of extra (i.e., null) data in the underlying relational database. Our approach does not assume a particular query workload, relevant for RDF knowledge bases with a large number of ad-hoc queries. Extensive experimental evidence using three publicly available real-world RDF data sets (i.e., DBLP, DBPedia, and Uniprot) shows that our schema creation technique provides superior query processing performance compared to state-of-the art storage approaches.

Promptly identifying the bottleneck of cloud application and consequently taking corrective actions (e.g. admission control) are essential requirements for cloud application performance management. The traditional threshold based bottleneck detection technology, which adopts a pre-defined target performance measure (e.g. response time, CPU utilization, etc.), requires a good understanding of the application. It is difficult to identify which performance measures need to be monitored and how to set accurate threshold values for them. The commonly used technique of model-based workload management also faces a big challenge in modeling the highly dynamic, cloud application behavior. In this paper, we propose a self-optimizing application workload management solution for cloud applications which adapts well to the cloud dynamics. It utilizes a target-less bottleneck detection mechanism, without the need to define target thresholds. It also contains a model-free controller for workload management, thus avoiding the complexity of dynamically changing the model as the cloud environment changes. We believe that this is the first time such a design principle to cloud application performance management is introduced.

Then this paper applies genetic algorithm to solve the dynamic resource allocation model so as to improve the resolving efficiency. Finally, the approach proposed in this paper is evaluated and compared with some related algorithms.

As an important tool to alleviate information overload, mobile service recommendation has attracted more and more attention. However, traditional recommendation algorithms always recommend popular services to users, which result into a rich-get-richer problem and become a barrier for the unpopular services to startup and growth. In order to promote the healthy development of the service ecosystem, it is necessary to guarantee the fairness of unpopular services. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fairness-aware mobile service recommendation method (FMSR), which gives a relatively fair recommendation opportunity for unpopular services. FMSR makes a tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and fairness, and can recommend popular services and unpopular services respectively. For unpopular services, we design a fair efficiency function and use combinatorial optimization techniques to achieve recommendations. For popular services, bias matrix factorization is utilized to implement recommendations. Experimental results based on real-world demonstrate that FMSR significantly improve the fairness of mobile service recommendation in the evolving mobile service ecosystem.'),(5351,'conf/icws/Chou08','Wu Chou','Web Services: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Communication.','1','2008','conf/icws/2008',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.140','db/conf/icws/icws2008.html#Chou08','Beijing, China','Web services is a fast moving research field with a profound impact to many critical research areas, ranging from software to communication, from server platforms to mobile endpoints.

A schema-specific parsing method is developed that uses a two-stack push-down automaton (PDA) for single-pass parsing and validation without backtracking. The schema validity constraints are packed in a compact parsing table derived from a permutation phrase grammar. This approach reduces both the space and time requirements of XML parsing and validation. By contrast, other XML schema-specific parsing methods trade efficiency for space (larger code and/or data size) or trade space for efficiency (backtracking).

Thus, a challenging problem is how to identify K optimal social trust paths that can yield the K most trustworthy evaluation results based on service consumers\' evaluation criteria. In this paper, we first present a complex social network structure and a concept, Quality of Trust (QoT). We then model the K optimal social trust paths selection with multiple end-to-end QoT constraints as the Multiple Constrained K Optimal Paths (MCOP-K) selection problem, which is NP-Complete. For solving this challenging problem, based on Dijkstra\'s shortest path algorithm and our optimization strategies, we propose a heuristic algorithm H-OSTP-K with the time complexity of O(m+Knlogn).

To this end, we present URoad, an efficient algorithm for large-scale dynamic ridesharing service, where a new price cost model is carefully designed to make up for the shortcomings of existing algorithms, and in the meantime a corresponding efficient matching algorithm is proposed to satisfy both the time and cost constraints of passengers and drivers. Specifically, for a given passenger, URoad will find out the optimal driver who can satisfy all the constraints of the passenger and the driver with the minimum detour distance. We design a series of data structures to speed up URoad for large scale ridesharing service application, e.g., Time Index, Grid Index and Greedy Strategy.

However, two important issues, unreliable service providing and resource constraints, make the modeling and analysis of service composition in IoT a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to formally describe and analyze the reliability and cost-related properties of the service composition in IoT. First, a service composition in IoT is modeled as a finite state machine (FSM) which focuses on the functional part. Then, we extend this FSM model to a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which can specify the reliability of service operations. Furthermore, we extend MDP with cost structure, which can represent the different service quality attributes for each operation, such as energy consumption, communication cost, etc. The desirable quality properties of the service composition are specified by a probabilistic extension of temporal logic PCTL. We adopt a well-established probabilistic model checker PRISM to verify and analyze those properties of our service composition models.'),(5407,'conf/icws/NguyenKP06','Xuan Thang Nguyen||Ryszard Kowalczyk||Manh Tan Phan','Modelling and Solving QoS Composition Problem Using Fuzzy DisCSP.','55-62','2006','conf/icws/2006',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2006.93','db/conf/icws/icws2006.html#NguyenKP06','Chicago, IL','Web service compositions have attracted considerable efforts in the context of supporting enterprise application integrations.

However, these composition techniques are limited to using one formalism for specifying the required functionality, in short, the existing techniques cannot identify optimal (w.r.t. non-functional properties) composite services that are required to satisfy functional requirements described in multiple formalisms. We have previously proposed a meta-framework for service composition that involves decomposing the required functionality into a boolean combination of atomic requirements, which are expressed using different formalisms. This meta-framework supports the use of multiple formalisms and their corresponding composition algorithms within a single scenario.

To solve the above issues, a novel method of Targeted Reconstructing Service Descriptions (TRSD) for a specific mashup query is proposed, resorting to the valuable information hidden in mashup descriptions. TRSD aims at introducing mashup descriptions into service descriptions by analyzing the similarity between existing mashups and the specific query, while leveraging service system structure information. Benefit from this approach, missing application scenarios in original service descriptions, query-specific application scenario information, mashup developers\' language habits, and service system structure information are all integrated into the reconstructed service descriptions. Based on the reconstructed service description by TRSD, a new service recommendation strategy is developed.

In this paper, we modeled a SVB Web service as an integration of two layers with the business interface (BIF) and the technical interface (TIF). With this distinction, Web service compositions can map to two layers of compositions at both BIF and TIF levels. We notice that any partial consideration on the consistency of either BIF or TIF layers would likely leave mismatching situations on the other layer. We employ SVB to solve these mismatching situations. With the help of SVB, we address the needs of coherent business planning and IT implementation in a model drivenmanner. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of our approach in the development of a modern cloud-based tourism e-commerce platform.'),(5431,'conf/icws/AminCG12','Ayman Amin||Alan Colman||Lars Grunske','An Approach to Forecasting QoS Attributes of Web Services Based on ARIMA and GARCH Models.','74-81','2012','conf/icws/2012',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2012.37','db/conf/icws/icws2012.html#AminCG12','Honolulu, HI','Availability of several web services having a similar functionality has led to using quality of service (QoS) attributes to support services selection and management. To improve these operations and be performed proactively, time series ARIMA models have been used to forecast the future QoS values. However, the problem is that in this extremely dynamic context the observed QoS measures are characterized by a high volatility and time-varying variation to the extent that existing ARIMA models cannot guarantee accurate QoS forecasting where these models are based on a homogeneity (constant variation over time) assumption, which can introduce critical problems such as proactively selecting a wrong service and triggering unrequired adaptations and thus leading to follow-up failures and increased costs. To address this limitation, we propose a forecasting approach that integrates ARIMA and GARCH models to be able to capture the QoS attributes\' volatility and provide accurate forecasts. Using QoS datasets of real-world web services we evaluate the accuracy and performance aspects of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms the popular existing ARIMA models and improves the forecasting accuracy of QoS measures and violations by on average 28.7% and 15.3% respectively.'),(5432,'conf/icws/MengLY10','Shicong Meng||Ling Liu 0001||Jianwei Yin','Scalable and Reliable IPTV Service Through Collaborative Request Dispatching.','179-186','2010','conf/icws/2010',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.26','db/conf/icws/icws2010.html#MengLY10','Miami, FL','IPTV has emerged as the future standard of television and drawn enormous attention from both industry and research communities. Among different IPTV services, on-demand services are the most popular ones due to their convenience and rich content. However, supporting scalable and reliable on-demand IPTV services remains to be an important challenge. Existing IPTV architecture dedicates a centralized regional station to serve subscribers in the respective region regardless of temporal and spatial dynamics in service demand. As a result, it may cause significant imbalance of resource utilization and service provisioning delay at different stations, especially with increasing subscribers and video content. In this paper, we propose to allow IPTV stations of different regions to collaboratively serve user requests for delivering scalable and reliable IPTV services. One key challenge in achieving this station-wise collaboration is to route service requests to appropriate stations according to cost-effectiveness and load distribution in a fully distributed manner. We devise a novel request dispatching protocol which runs on each IPTV station, and yet forms a collaborative dispatching strategy that avoids hot spots and reduces service delivery cost at the same time. Our experiment results suggest that our service request dispatching algorithm significantly improves the scalability of on-demand IPTV services for the existing IPTV architecture.'),(5433,'conf/icws/VermaGC09','Ashish Verma||Tyrone Grandison||Himanshu Chauhan','Enabling Scaleable, Efficient, Non-visual Web Browsing Services.','1037-1038','2009','conf/icws/2009',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.131','db/conf/icws/icws2009.html#VermaGC09','Los Angeles, CA',NULL),(5434,'conf/icws/ColgraveAG04','John Colgrave||Rama Akkiraju||Richard Goodwin','External Matching in UDDI.','226-','2004','conf/icws/2004',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2004.1314743','db/conf/icws/icws2004.html#ColgraveAG04','San Diego, CA','As an industry-backed registry for Web Services, UDDI plays an important role in helping requesters find suitable services.

Currently, the prevalent trust evaluation mechanism employs the overall approval rate of HITs, with which dishonest workers can easily succeed in pursuing the maximal profit by quickly giving plausible answers or counterfeiting HITs approval rates. In crowd sourcing environments, a worker\'s trustworthiness varies in contexts, i.e. It varies in different types of tasks and different reward amounts of tasks. Thus, we propose two classifications based on task types and task reward amount respectively. On the basis of the classifications, we propose a trust evaluation model, which consists of two types of context-aware trust: task type based trust (TaTrust) and reward amount based trust (RaTrust). Then, we model trustworthy worker selection as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, which is NP-hard. For solving this challenging problem, we propose an evolutionary algorithm MOWS_GA based on NSGA-II.

In this paper we hybridise NSGA-II with MOEA/D, which allows the problem to be decomposed into multiple single-objective subproblems where a simple form of local search can be applied.

This process requires intensive human effort on labeling services in the training set. In this paper, we propose to leverage the idea of pool-based active learning to realize a scalable service classification approach. Instead of manually labeling a large number of services to construct a complete training set, the approach starts with a base classifier with a small set of training set and iteratively asks for the labels of the most informative services outside of the initial training set. By doing this, the classifier can achieve comparable accuracy compared to traditional classification method with much smaller size of training set. We use SVM as the base classifier due to its effectiveness in text classification.

This paper presents a trusted anonymous social network service that can anonymize user identities during interaction even though the communication happens with the user\'s own trusted friends and contacts on the social network. A fundamental requirement of such a trusted anonymous social networks is to protect the user\'s identity under the guarantees of anonymity. However, in existing approaches, even though the user information is anonymized, by continuously aggregating the information from the messages posted by a user, it is possible to re-identify the user with high probability. In this paper, we propose SocialMix that anonymizes the users of a trusted social network such that the aggregation of messages can be prevented. We make three original contributions. First, we develop the SocialMix model for trusted anonymous social networks so that communication privacy can be protected by k-anonymization. Second, by considering the features of OSNs, we analyze the vulnerabilities of the naive methods that might be exploited to break the privacy. We develop new techniques to improve the attack-resilience of the SocialMix approach.

However, in the majority of such services, context-handling is still tightly coupled with the core functionality of the service, resulting in a design which is difficult to implement and maintain. The paper proposes the decoupling of core service logic from context-related functionality by adopting a model-driven approach based on a modified version of the ContextUML metamodel.

Many cloud applications need privacy preserving multiple keywords search services over encrypted data with dual capabilities. On one hand, they need to keep the query keywords and associated search operations private such that data hosting service providers cannot trace and infer sensitive data stored in the third party data hosting servers. On the other hand, they need to support multiple keywords search to significantly improve the search efficiency. However, current keyword search protocols for encrypted data are not practical with poor privacy and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new oblivious multiple keywords search (OMKS) service, which provides privacy for both users and cloud storage service provider and supports efficient multiple keywords search. Compared to previous oblivious keyword search (OKS) protocols, our protocols maintain strong privacy, i.e., database security and query privacy, and effectively support disjunctive and conjunctive keywords search. The analysis and experiments show that OMKS protocols significantly reduce the storage and communication overhead. Moreover, the computation overhead of conjunctive search is not increased with the number of query keywords such that it can performs highly efficient conjunctive keywords search.'),(5458,'conf/icws/DhesiaseelanR04','Arulazi Dhesiaseelan||Venkatavaradan Ragunathan','Web Services Container Reference Architecture (WSCRA).','806-805','2004','conf/icws/2004',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2004.1314828','db/conf/icws/icws2004.html#DhesiaseelanR04','San Diego, CA','Today, Web services are pervasive and omnipresent in the Internet and within enterprises.

The Stream Web system allows developers to easily describe their analytical algorithms for a variety of kinds of Web streaming data without worrying about the performance and scalability, and provides real-time and scalable Web monitoring for massive amounts of data.

Developers in their role as requesters integrate existing services of different providers into new IT-systems. Providers use frameworks like Open API to create syntactic service specifications from which requesters generate code to integrate services. Proper service discovery is crucial to identify usable services in the growing plethora of third-party services. Most advanced service discovery approaches rely on semantic specifications, e.g., OWL-S. While semantic specifications are crucial for a precise discovery, syntactical specification are needed for service invocation. To close the gap between semantic and syntactic specifications, service grounding establishes links between the semantic and syntactic specifications. However, for a large number of web services still no semantic specification or grounding exists. In this paper, we present an approach that semi-automates the semantic specification of web services for service providers and additionally helps service requesters to leverage semantic web services. Our approach enables a higher degree of automation than other approaches. This includes the creation of semantic specifications and service groundings for service providers as well as the integration of services for requesters by using our code generator.

To analyze these logs is of great value for the promotion of express delivery service. For any research based on trajectory data, map-matching plays an important role, so in this article, we design a map-matching service specially for courier trajectories. As far as we know, existing map-matching algorithms are designed mainly for cars or walks, or ignoring means of transportation. Although these methods can be applied to courier trajectory map-matching, the accuracy of them can hardly be guaranteed as they ignore the characteristics of courier trajectories. To solve this problem, we design a new map-matching service based on a map-matching algorithm called Courier Trajectory Based Map-Matching (CTB-Matching), which is specially used to deal with courier trajectories. Courier trajectories have some characteristics different from traditional trajectories. Firstly, couriers have to deliver shipments at different sites, so the trajectories seem more irregular, which is called as \"fragmentation\" problem. Secondly, unlike cars, couriers\' positioning information is mainly generated by Wi-Fi location system, which is not precise as Global Position System (GPS), so the location deviation problem should be taken into account. What\'s more, couriers usually use electric bikes for delivery, which travel slower than cars, and are less likely to be influenced by traffic. Therefore, the speed or temporal analysis for cars is not suitable here. Based on the analysis of current algorithms and the problems stated above, this paper designs a map-matching service for courier trajectory data. The experiments verify that our service performs better when dealing with courier trajectory data.

To deal with collaborative processes (choreographies) these internal workflow models have to be aligned with the external behaviour advertised through Web service interfaces. However, traditional workflow management systems (WfMS) do not offer this functionality. Simply sharing and merging process models is often not possible, because workflow management lacks a widely accepted standard theory for workflow models.Multiple research and standardisation efforts to integrate different workflow theories have been proposed over the years. XPDL is the most widely used standard for process model interchange and supported by over 80 systems.However, XPDL also lacks the possibility to relate a workflow model to its possible choreography interface abstractions.To remedy this situation, we propose to abstract the XPDL model to a higher-level model, perform the integration and the compaction algorithms at that level and then ground it back to the desired choreography models. We develop and use an integrated ontology which is based on the XPDL standard for this purpose. To facilitate the abstraction and grounding, we present a mapping procedure to automatically translate XPDL and BPMN workflow models into this ontology. After translation, these models are annotated with a parameterised role model and other collaborative properties. We present a compaction procedure that automatically maps the annotated models into external choreography interfaces that expose only the relevant information for a particular partner collaboration. Our procedure is agnostic with respect to the target choreography model. We demonstrate our approach using WSMO choreographies which enables us to automatically generate interface models from any WfMSs that supports XPDL export.'),(5488,'conf/icws/ZhangHL12','Jing Zhang 0005||Zhenqiu Huang||Kwei-Jay Lin','A Hybrid Diagnosis Approach for QoS Management in Service-Oriented Architecture.','82-89','2012','conf/icws/2012',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2012.38','db/conf/icws/icws2012.html#ZhangHL12','Honolulu, HI','Service flow in SOA systems need to detect quality of service (QoS) problems and to guarantee end-to-end performance.

This poor design practice typically result in a system which is difficult to comprehend, maintain and evolve providing low performance and reusability. To address this problem, we present an automated approach, SIM, to support service developers improve the quality of their interface modularization. Our approach analyzes structural and semantic relationships among the operations exposed in a service interface to identify chains of strongly related operations. The identified operation chains are used to define new interfaces with higher cohesion and better usability. We empirically evaluate our approach on a benchmark of 22 realworld Web services, provided by Amazon and Yahoo. The obtained results show that the produced interfaces are (i) able to improve the service design quality, and (ii) recognized as \'useful\' from developers point of view in improving their service design.

Today applications are deployed on heterogeneous distributed infra-structure from mobile devices to cloud computing. Service-oriented architectures, such as SOA and REST Web Services, have been widely used to efficiently design high-availability, scalable and reliable systems for dynamic business environments based on a distributed infra-structure. Despite the improvements these architectures have made to enhance the evolvability of systems, there are some challenges that still need to be overcome. More concretely, service-based systems and development teams are constantly under pressure from business stakeholders who continuously increase their demands for changes in systems. This paper describes a configuration-based approach that can empower adaptive mechanisms in order to overcome this challenge. It presents a solution based on a centralized application configuration repository service specially designed as a RESTful web service API to provide the benefits of configuration, such as adaptability, to high-availability, scalable and loosely coupled systems, allowing them to respond quickly to changes. The solution was successfully implemented in an evolutionary online advertising system used by the largest Brazilian web-portal, responsible for processing 5 billion ad requests per month. It allowed the design of a self-adaptive advertisement ranking mechanism that continuously evolves the system configuration, without human supervision. The adoption of this solution was responsible for a drastic increase in the amount of changes applied in this advertising environment. It also greatly reduced the time from conceiving a new change to having it working in the system. Moreover, the solution is available as open source and it has also being used by several other service-based systems.'),(5494,'conf/icws/VasiliuZMBB04','Laurentiu Vasiliu||Michal Zaremba||Matthew Moran||Christoph Bussler||Jim Browne','Web-Service Semantic Enabled Implementation of Machine vs.Machine Business Negotiation.','106-115','2004','conf/icws/2004',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2004.1314729','db/conf/icws/icws2004.html#VasiliuZMBB04','San Diego, CA','The ultimate target of business to business (B2B) integration and deployment is complete business process automation within and between enterprises with no human intervention.

Traditional service management processes within organizations, in particular change management, relies on a central configuration management database (CMDB) to assess the impact a change has on other components of the system.

However, such an interleaved log is typical for many systems especially web-based ones where all the user-system interaction traces are recorded and maintained by a web server. Dealing with interleaved logs is challenging due to the lack of prior knowledge of workflow models and noises contained in the log data. In this paper, we propose a two-phase workflow learning process. During the first phase, we use a probabilistic approach to learn the links between operations and the hidden workflow models. We consider a workflow model as a probabilistic distributions over operations and derive it through likelihood maximization. This allows us to identify the membership of an operation to a workflow model, which can be used to unravel a log record and generate a set of workflow instances from it.

Business processes can be self-contained or be composed from sub-processes; the latter category is typically specified using the Web services business process execution language (WS-BPEL) and executed by a Web services orchestrator (WSO). During the execution however of such a composite service, a number of faults stemming from the distributed nature of the SOA architecture, e.g. network or server failures may occur. WS-BPEL includes provisions for exception handling, which can be exploited for detecting such failures; once detected, a failure can be resolved by invoking alternate Web service implementations that perform the same business task as the failed one. However, the inclusion of such provisions is a tedious assignment for the business process designer, while additional effort would be required to maintain the BPEL scenarios in cases that some alternate WS implementations cease to exist or new ones are introduced. In our research we are developing a framework for automating handling of that kind of exceptions. The proposed solution employs a pre-processor that enhances BPEL scenarios with code that detects failures, discovers alternate WS implementations and invokes them, fully thus resolving the exception. Alternate WS implementation discovery is based on service relevance, which takes into account both functional and qualitative properties of Web services.'),(5516,'conf/icws/FletcherL15','Kenneth K.

However, using these nonfunctional attribute values from invoked services alone in similarity computation for personalized service recommendation is not sufficient. This is because two users may invoke the same service, but their personalized preferences on nonfunctional attributes that describe the service may be different. Thus, to accurately personalize service recommendation, it is necessary for CF-based recommendation systems to incorporate users personalized preferences on nonfunctional attributes when recommending services to an active user. This paper proposes a CF-based service recommendation method that considers users\' personalized preference on nonfunctional attributes. We first compute the satisfaction of an active user\'s preference on nonfunctional attribute(s) and then use these satisfaction values to obtain their similarity measures. We then employ the top-k algorithm to identify neighbors of the active user and subsequently, use the weighted average with mean offset method to predict his/her nonfunctional attribute.

A challenging task towards this purpose is the selection of the best combination of services that fulfils user\'s requirements while meeting quality of service (QoS) constraints. This challenge becomes more complex when dealing with time-dependent QoS values and temporal properties. Indeed, during the selection, mutual dependencies between the different temporal constraints may arise so that the selection of each service may influence or be influenced by the selection of other services. On other side, to find the best solution, all potential combinations must be compared. However, the number of these combinations may be very high, which can present a barrier for enabling effective service selection. In this paper, we present a heuristic based time-aware service selection approach to efficiently select a close-to-optimal combination of services. First, pruning techniques are adopted to reduce the search space.

However, the majority of current CF-based service recommendation approaches predict users\' interests through the historical usage data, but not the service description. This makes them suitable for making QoS-based recommendation, but not for functionality-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose to use machine learning approaches to recommend web services to users from both historical usage data and service descriptions. Considering the great popularity of Restful services, our approach is applicable to both structured and unstructured service description, i.e., Free text descriptions. We exploit the idea of collaborative topic regression, which combines both probabilistic matrix factorization and probabilistic topic modeling, to form user-related, service-related, and topic related latent factor models and use them to predict user interests.

The proliferation of deception cases makes it essential and challenging to model the dynamics of a service provider and predict the trustworthiness of the service provider in transactions. Recently, probabilistic trust models have been used to assist decision making in computing environments. Although the typical Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to model a provider\'s behavior dynamics, existing approaches focus only on the outcomes or ignore the hidden characteristics of the HMM model. In this paper, we model the dynamic trust of service providers concerning a forthcoming transaction in light of as much information as we can consider, including the static features, such as the provider\'s reputation and item price, and the dynamic features, such as the latest profile changes of a service provider and price changes. Based on a service provider\'s historical transactions, we predict the trustworthiness of the service provider in a forthcoming transaction. In addition, the Mutual Information theories and the Principle Component Analysis method are leveraged to eliminate redundant information and combine essential features to form lower dimensional feature vectors. Furthermore, by adopting Vector Quantization techniques, we apply the discrete HMM in a more powerful way, in which all the features extracted from both contextual information and the rating of each transaction are treated as observations of HMM. We evaluate our approach empirically in order to study its performance.

Specifically, we address the issue where a high-level change (e.g. change in business policy or rolling out of a new service) necessitates external events (generated from other enterprise system) to be handled by running workflow (WF) instances in the WFMS. Current solutions either require a change in the workflow process definition or change in the workflow engine - both being cost intensive solutions from an enterprise \'s point of view since they compromise on enterprise backend downtime. HEMM circumvents this by introducing an overlay on top of existing WFMS and abstracting out unforeseen event handling from workflows. At the same time, it employs event transformation to map events to appropriate event handlers of running workflow instances, enabling them to adapt to new events that their process definitions do not handle. We demonstrate our prototype implementation with the example of rolling out a bundled service that is prevalent in telecom industry.'),(5541,'conf/icws/MokarizadehKMCCZ12','Shahab Mokarizadeh||Peep Küngas||Mihhail Matskin||Marco Crasso||Marcelo Campo||Alejandro Zunino','Information Diffusion in Web Services Networks.','488-495','2012','conf/icws/2012',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2012.89','db/conf/icws/icws2012.html#MokarizadehKMCCZ12','Honolulu, HI','Information diffusion has been studied between and within biosphere, microblogs, social networks, citation networks and other domains, where the network structure is present.

First we present a software-based scheme with a linear runtime that uses a finite set of pre-selected message templates for differential encoding of SOAP messages. We propose generating the templates by extracting the longest common subsequence from a representative set of SOAP messages encountered during the service operation. Next we present an architecture for line-rate implementation of data differencing functionality in hardware.

We test both schemes on a sample workload running on a SOAP based Business Intelligence software platform. Our results show that the proposed techniques can achieve an average of 10X reduction in the overall SOAP traffic.

A key step for temporal-based CARS methods is to explore the time decay process of past invocation records to make the Quality of Services (QoS) prediction. However, it is a nontrivial task to model the temporal effects on web services recommendation, due to the dynamic features of contextual information in view of temporal spatial correlations. For instance, in location-aware services recommendation, the user\'s geographical position would change very frequently as time goes on. In this paper, we propose a Context-Aware Services Recommendation based on Temporal Effectiveness (CASR-TE) method. Inspired by existing time decay approaches, we first present an enhanced temporal decay model combining the time decay function with traditional similarity measurement methods. Then, we model temporal spatial correlations as well as their impacts on the user preference expansion.

To help the integration process, it is of significant interest to understand the challenges that are encountered by client developers.

In this paper, we mine both developer forums and Stack Overflow to find the common challenges encountered by client developers. We perform an empirical study on 32 Web APIs with a total of 92,471 discussions. To extract topics from all discussions, we apply a topic modeling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The results show that on average five dominant topics can cover at least 50% of questions regarding each Web API. We further investigate how topics evolve across Web APIs, and find five patterns.

At the heart of most service discovery mechanisms is a matchmaking algorithm that matches a semantic query to a set of compatible web service advertisements. These advertisements also describe service semantics as a set of OWL-S terms. Most current matchmaking algorithms are based on semantic matching of input and output terms alone. However, a complete description of the service profile also includes preconditions and effects and in order to find a true match the matchmaker needs to match on these aspects of the advertisement as well. In this paper, we make the case for augmenting existing matchmaking algorithms with preconditions and effects in the context of Web Services. Further, we propose an algorithm for condition matching that is layered on the top of input-output term matching that overcomes the limitations of existing work. Although the problem of condition matching is NP-Complete, we can overcome this limitation by using a set of heuristics that gives us results in polynomial time. We also analyze complexity of the algorithm by comparing it with brute force approach of matching.

Object coherence in platform-specific and tightly-coupled systems is achieved with binary serialization protocols to ensure data structures and object graphs are safely transmitted, manipulated, and stored. On the opposite side of the spectrum are platform-neutral Web services that embrace XML as a serialization protocol for building loosely coupled systems. The advantages of XML to connect heterogeneous systems are plenty, but rendering programming-language specific data structures and object graphs in text form incurs a performance hit and presents challenges for systems that require object coherence. Achieving the latter goal poses difficulties by a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to as the \"impedance mismatch\" between programming language data types and XML schema types. This paper examines the problem, debunks the O/X-mismatch controversy, and presents a mix of static/dynamic algorithms for accurate XML serialization.

This paper addresses a plausible solution to the first sub problem. Given a collection of Web services, we propose a framework for suggesting a set of candidate Web services that can be introduced to the collection. These suggested services are novel and do not present in the given collection. Our solution relies on the network structure of Web services for finding and recommending new Web services and utilizes the already observed properties of Web services networks for collective evaluation of the suggested services.

Service Oriented Computing (SOC) is a typical example of such environment in which the quality of interactions amongst software agents is a critical concern. Agent-based web services in open and distributed architectures need to interact with each other to achieve their goals and fulfill complex user requests. Two common tasks are influenced by the quality of interactions among web services: the selection and composition. Thus, to ensure the maximum gain in both tasks, it is essential for each agent-based web service to maintain a model of its environment. This model then provides a means for a web service to predict the quality of future interactions with its peers. In this paper, we formulate this model as a machine learning problem which we analyze by modeling the trustworthiness of web services using probabilistic models. We propose two approaches for trust learning of single and composed services; Bayesian Networks and Mixture of Multinomial Dirichlet Distributions (MMDD). The effectiveness of our approaches is empirically assessed using a simulation study. Our results show that representing the quality of a web service by Multinomial Dirichlet Distribution (MDD) provides high flexibility and accuracy in modeling trust.

However, large-scale graphs processing on traditional platforms suffers from difficulties including computation and memory inefficiency. To enhance the computation-efficiency and energy-efficiency, in this paper, we exploit graph processing services on the energy-efficient hardware accelerator, called Domino. Domino adopts the asynchronous model to process graphs, which is efficient for many graph algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and Single Source Shortest Path. Domino also proposes a specific data structure based on row vectors to present graphs, named Batch Row Vector. Besides, our work employs naive update mechanism and bisect update mechanism to perform the asynchronous control. Ultimately, we implement Domino on an advanced Xilinx Virtex-7 board, and experimental results demonstrated that Domino has a significant performance and energy improvement. Case studies in Domino achieve 1.47x-7.84x and 0.47x-2.52x average speedup for small-diameter graphs(e.g., com-youtube, WikiTalk, and soc-LiveJournal), over GraphChi on the Intel Core2 and Core i7 processors, respectively.

Since system structure can influence the efficiency of service discovery, structural self-organization mechanism should be used to facilitate the decentralized service discovery in the system.

Therefore, the intermediary utility can be used to improve the efficiency of structural self-organization and service search. However, the existing self-organization based service discovery approaches ignore this issue.

This paper presents a schema slicing method to remove unused schema components from schemas, thereby significantly reducing the XML data binding code size of WSDL-based Web Services. Our results show that schema slicing applied to large Web Services, such as ONVIF, results in the removal of 70% of the schema components on average. Our method also obtains significant schema size reductions for several popular WSDL-based Web Services, such as eBay Web Services (10% reduction), PayPal Web Services (18% reduction), Microsoft Exchange Web Services (4% reduction), Amazon S3 Web Services (22% reduction) and ESRI ArcGIS Web Services (42% to 59% reduction).

Different efforts are now introducing messaging notions such as asynchrony, greater consumer cardinality, and looser coupling between Web services. This trend will likely result in an extension of the Web services programming model. It is not clear, however, that this extension will adhere to a pre-planned approach. A coherent approach requires a thorough integration of the Web services and messaging paradigms. This paper proposes one such approach which, in addition to supporting the current style of Web services interactions, allows the incorporation of messaging-style interactions under a common programming model. These messaging-style interactions include asynchronous request-response, oneway multi-consumer interactions, and even multiple-choice point-to-point interactions, common in message queuing systems. This paper also elaborates on a model for oneway multi-consumer interactions that integrates the publish/subscribe mode of messaging into the Web services programming model. A primary motivation for our approach is to take advantage of key messaging features, while exerting as small an impact as possible on the Web services programming model'),(5648,'conf/icws/BoulakbechMSD17','Marwa Boulakbech||Nizar Messai||Yacine Sam||Thomas Devogele','Visual Configuration for RESTful Mobile Web Mashups.','870-873','2017','conf/icws/2017',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2017.109','db/conf/icws/icws2017.html#BoulakbechMSD17','Honolulu, HI','The fast development of powerful mobile devices and rich Internet applications have boosted the production of Mobile Web applications designed to support end-users in their daily activities using smartphones.

However, accountability aspects, mainly the monitoring of the execution of a service contract, liability assignment and dispute arbitration are still lacking. On the one hand, the traditional centralized monitoring and the trusted-third party (TTP) based arbitration solutions are not suitable for the distributed cloud environment. On the other hand, a decentralized solution also faces challenges in guaranteeing fairness, accuracy and sustainability. To address this issue, this paper firstly proposes an innovative service contract management scheme that facilitates the monitoring of the execution of a service contract in a peer-to-peer environment, inspired by the concept of blockchain in Bitcoin. Secondly, on top of the scheme it presents a novel dispute resolution protocol based on the Byzantine agreement and the commitment scheme. Thirdly, it identifies the optimal settings of the key parameters of the protocol through a set of experiments and scenario analysis, aiming to strike the balance of fairness, accuracy, incentive maximization for the honest arbiters and cost minimization for the overall arbitration process. With this approach, service participants can be held accountable in a truly distributed environment without the presence of a central authority, which increases businesses confidence on adopting cloud services.'),(5651,'conf/icws/LeffR10','Avraham Leff||James T.

For example, developers of situational applications prefer to use scripting languages because the \"duck typing\" style of programming language allows them to ignore issues related to class inheritance or interface implementation. In comparison to strongly-typed languages, developers can begin programming more quickly, and can modify their program more rapidly in response to changing requirements.

In this paper, we model services, attributes, and the associated entities, such as providers, consumers, by a heterogeneous service network. We propose a unified neighborhood random walk distance measure, which integrates various types of links and vertex attributes by a local optimal weight assignment. Based on this unified distance measure, a reinforcement algorithm, ServiceRank, is provided to tightly integrate ranking and clustering by mutually and simultaneously enhancing each other such that the performance of both can be improved. An additional clustering matching strategy is proposed to efficiently align clusters from different types of objects.

However, it is still difficult to build, deploy, and evolve such services, since different Web and grid services containers require that the services they host be written in specific languages, to target particular internal interfaces for state management. Therefore, services must be built and deployed differently for each hosting environment. This paper describes uniform dynamic service code deployment on three Web services containers (namely, Tomcat, ASP.NET and a gSOAP based C++ container), and two grid services containers (namely, GT4 and WSRF.NET). Containers receive the code in an XML-based standard intermediate form, and then generate container-specific native code in different languages, without exposing these details to applications and grid services programmers. The dynamically deployed code can access state managed by the hosting container, can utilize functionalities exposed by statically deployed services, and can communicate with other dynamically deployed modules, running either in the same container or in different containers. A performance study shows that the newly deployed mobile code can run nearly as efficiently as it would if it had been deployed statically, through container-specific mechanisms.'),(5666,'conf/icws/GuptaBHGM07','Chaitali Gupta||Rajdeep Bhowmik||Michael R.

Making optimal decisions toward the purchase of IaaS instances generally requires prior knowledge of future demands; however, it is difficult for users to predict all future workloads accurately.

Dynamic access patterns due to the web cache mechanism in proxy servers increase mispredictions to waste the I/O bandwidth and available memory. Too aggressive prefetch schemes incur the shortage of available memory and performance degradation. Furthermore, modern web frameworks including persistent HTTP make the problem more challenging by reducing the available memory space with multiple connections from a client and web processes management in a prefork mode. Therefore, we attempt to design an adaptive web prefetch scheme by predicting memory status more accurately and dynamically.

However, it has been shown that service developers tend to pay little care to the design of their interfaces. A common design issue that often appears in real-world Web services is that their interfaces lack cohesion, i.e., they expose several operations that are often semantically unrelated. Such a bad design practice may significantly complicate the comprehension and reuse of the services functionalities and lead to several maintenance and evolution problems. In this paper, we propose a new approach for Web service interface decomposition using a Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) framework. The proposed FCA-based approach aims at identifying the hidden relationships among service operations in order to improve the interface modularity and usability. The relationships between operations are based on cohesion measures including semantic, sequential and communicational cohesion. The identified groups of semantically related operations having common properties are used to define new cohesive and loosely coupled service interfaces.

Starting from an abstract workflow, concrete services are matched, based on their QoS, with the preferences and constraints of users. Current approaches usually only consider static QoS values and find a single solution consisting of one concrete service for each workflow task. In a business-to-business (B2B) environment, though, there are additional requirements for service compositions: 1) a high number of invocations, and 2) a high reliability. Thus, we introduce a probabilistic approach on the basis of a new QoS model to solve the composition problem for such long-term B2B service compositions. For each task and for every point in time, we determine the most appropriate services and backup services for a specific user. Thus, the selection depends on the actual response time and reliability, or recent invocation failures or timeouts. For that purpose, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm that employs our QoS model and determines backup services dynamically based on the required reliability.

In this regard, it can be modeled as a general matrix completion problem, which is to recover a large QoS matrix from a small subset of QoS entires. The infinite number of ways to complete an arbitrary QoS matrix makes the problem extremely ill posed. The highly sparse QoS data further complicates the challenges. Nonetheless, real-world QoS data exhibits two key features, which can be leveraged for accurate QoS predictions, leading to high-quality service recommendations. First, QoS delivery can be significantly affected by a small number dominant factors in the service environment (e.g., communication link and user-service distance). Hence, it is natural to assume that the QoS matrix has a low-rank or approximately low-rank structure. Second, users (or services) that share common environmental factors are expected to receive (or deliver) similar QoS and hence can be grouped together.

Conventional recommender algorithms, like the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, have been extensively studied and developed into a very mature stage, in which how to further promote user\'s favorite items and alleviate sparsity and cold start problem become increasingly important. In this paper, traditional recommender algorithms are promoted by exploring group\'s preference to mitigate the issues above and improve the predicting accuracy in both cases. Our work is based on the following observation. Users in the same group share common interests, given a group there are items that the group is most interested in, on the other hand, given some specific items there is the first-rate group which shows most preference compared to other groups. This leads to our proposed PromoRec algorithm which focuses on promoting items that users are most likely to prefer with sparse insensitivity since group enriches user\'s data largely. In a multi-dimensional space, we show how to efficiently compute (a) the most popular items for a target group and (b) the group which shows most interests in specific items. In addition, without the needs of available user group information, we propose an automatic classification algorithm based on users\' similar interests. To improve the recommendation accuracy, we use additional item classification information to help determine the similarity between users.

However, existing methods assume the QoS information for service users are all known and accurate, but in real case, there are always many missing QoS values in history records, which increase the difficulty of the missing QoS value prediction. By considering the user-service-time three dimension context information, we study a Temporal QoS-Aware Web Service Prediction Framework which aims to recommend best candidates to service user\'s requirements and meanwhile improve the QoS prediction accuracy. One major challenge is that how to deal with the high dimension, sparse QoS value data. Tensor which is known as multi-way array provides a natural representation for such QoS value data.

Many cloud applications need privacy preserving data encryption services with two capabilities: On one hand, they need querying over encrypted data in Web based data hosting services. On the other hand, they also need to keep the query keywords and associated search operations private such that data hosting service providers cannot gain access to unauthorized content or trace and infer sensitive data stored in the third party data hosting servers. In this paper we present a novel service oriented framework for verifiable searchable asymmetric encryption, called PVSAE. PVSAE offers strong support for outsourced encrypted data with two formal security properties in terms of IND-CKA security and search pattern privacy. Our framework supports two concrete PVSAE schemes. The first scheme l-PVSAE is based on the l-dimensional vectors and achieves strong security notions, namely statistical IND-CKA security and statistical search pattern privacy. The second scheme 3-PVSAE is a light-weight version based on 3-dimensional vectors. 3-PVSAE maintains the strong security properties and offers higher efficiency for search over encrypted data compared with existing verifiable searchable asymmetric encryption schemes. We experimentally evaluate the proposed PVSAE schemes and show that they not only offer strong security but also are practical and deployable.'),(5788,'conf/icws/ArsanjaniCM04','Ali Arsanjani||Francisco Curbera||Nirmal Mukhi','Manners Externalize Semantics for On-demand Composition of Context-aware Services.','583-590','2004','conf/icws/2004',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2004.1314785','db/conf/icws/icws2004.html#ArsanjaniCM04','San Diego, CA','Architectural mismatch; the semantic and syntactic gap preventing component composition, can be partially alleviated through the ubiquity of the protocols for service composition (syntax).

The contribution of this paper builds on the notions introduced by grammar-oriented object design (GOOD) using the notion of manners to specify the semantics of services and drive their automated composition through dynamically reconfigure architectures enabled through GOOD. This leads to the use of manners for explicit service semantics representation in a re-configurable architectural style. We describe the base requirements for automated component and services composition and show how automated assembly of components and services can be accomplished through a dynamically reconfigurable (DyRec) architectural style. In addition, we show how this vision of dynamic reconfiguration is naturally supported by the Web services framework, because it derives from some of the core requirements of the service oriented architectures (SOA) style embodied by Web services. Further, we discuss how such a DyRec architectural style can be implemented using grammar-oriented object design (GOOD) and describe a project that led to a tool called the Business Compiler, to accomplish dynamic composition and collaboration.'),(5789,'conf/icws/RiveraKFCY15','Diego Rivera||Natalia Kushik||Camila Fuenzalida||Ana R.

In order to fully leverage their power in a multi-agent environment with heterogeneous participants, the establishment of barrier-free communication between different parties is of prime concern. In particular, such an environment may consist of numerous entities, based on different implementations and with different nonfunctional requirements (NFRs), e.g. encryption key length or latency. Currently, interoperability between the involved parties in multi-agent systems is limited as there is no established way of elaborating a common set of NFRs. In this paper, we outline a Web services-based architecture addressing this issue of interoperability in multi-agent systems. Furthermore, we introduce a soft constraints-based approach for modeling and reconciling the NFRs. In particular, Web services serve as a tool for establishing an open system providing reliable communication between a variety of agent implementations and possible non-agent based entities while lacking the limitations of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), which are asynchronous in nature and closed in implementation. In this way, Web services enable the desired level of openness and robustness needed for maximum interoperability. Adding a soft constraints-based approach to the Web services agent layer provides an extensible and flexible mechanism for the reconciliation of interdependent NFRs. We present a prototype implementation of an open, Web services-based framework optimizing unary soft constraints in a pareto optimal way and therefore enabling barrier-free communication in a multi-agent scenario. Due to its open nature, the framework is applicable to any heterogeneous environment in need of reconciling NFRs.

However, due to inter-dependencies between sub-tasks, the complexity of the workflow, and the heterogeneity of clouds, it is a challenge to achieve the optimal tradeoff between cost and performance. This paper presents a novel workflow scheduler designed to achieve the optimal end-to-end execution time and cost when deploying such complex workflows in heterogeneous computing nodes in clouds. Specifically, our scheduling algorithm addresses the tradeoff between the execution cost, the computing time, and the data transfer delay between sub-tasks. Our scheduler can handle complex workflows that contain recursively paralleled sub-flows caused by branch and merging sub-tasks. Experiments indicate that our scheduler can efficiently compute the near optimal deployment compared with greedy and evolutionary algorithms for both end-to-end execution time and corresponding cost.'),(5800,'conf/icws/BerardiGMC06','Daniela Berardi||Giuseppe De Giacomo||Massimo Mecella||Diego Calvanese','ComposingWeb Services with Nondeterministic Behavior.','909-912','2006','conf/icws/2006',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2006.45','db/conf/icws/icws2006.html#BerardiGMC06','Chicago, IL','The promise of Web services is to enable the composition of new distributed applications/solutions: when no available service can satisfy a client request, (parts of) available services can be composed and orchestrated in order to satisfy such a request.

The problem is that if similar services have been identified based on high-level mappings, then schema constraints may be violated. To overcome this problem, we propose a proactive approach to identify similar services that satisfy schema constraints. In particular, our approach follows a composite workflow (instead of existing hybrid workflows), which determines schema constraints (service documents do not specify them) and estimates service-translation cost (actual cost is not available) as a function of ensured schema-constraints. We compare our approach against a state-of-the-art service-similarity approach on benchmark services and the results show that high service-similarity does not necessarily imply low service-translation cost, the bidirectional nature of service similarity can be misleading, ensured schema-constraints improve service similarity, and estimated translation-cost is very close to actual cost.'),(5825,'conf/icws/LiRW08','Chen Li 0012||Manfred Reichert||Andreas Wombacher','Discovering Reference Process Models by Mining Process Variants.','45-53','2008','conf/icws/2008',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICWS.2008.13','db/conf/icws/icws2008.html#LiRW08','Beijing, China','Recently, a new generation of adaptive Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS) has emerged, which allows for dynamic process and service changes (e.g., to insert, delete, and move activities and service executions in a running process).

To respond to a request, agents propose their best local partial plans which are partial paths in the graph.

This function ensures the optimality and the completeness of the algorithm. Indeed, it is based not only on the agent capabilities to respond to a request, but also taking into account the plans proposed by other agents. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial.

However, there are two challenges in integrating cloud and edge computing for big stream data. Firstly, edge equipment usually has very limited computing power as well as storage ability, and apparently cannot support all the processing of big and real-time stream data. A flexible division of such services between edge and cloud is needed. Secondly, edge-end collaboration continuously changes due to some intrinsic interaction of data stream. In this paper, we propose a service-based approach to seamlessly integrating cloud and edge equipment. Based on our service model, we split a cloud service into two parts running on cloud and edge respectively. Also, we propose a dynamic service scheduling mechanism based on the improved bipartite graphs. We can deploy a cloud service to the edge at the right time when a key node emerges.

In contrast to existing dictionary-based compression techniques, A- SOAP does not require dictionaries to be exchanged between the two endpoints in advance; its dictionaries are built incrementally, as the communication progresses.

As an NP-hard problem, high time complexity is inevitable if global optimization algorithms (such as integer programming) were adopted. Researchers applied various evolutionary algorithms to decrease the time complexity by looking for near optimum solution. However, each evolutionary algorithm has two or more parameters the value of which is to be assigned by algorithm designers and likely has impacts on the optimization results (primarily time complexity and optimality). Our experiments show that there are some dependencies between the features of service composition problems, the value of the evolutionary algorithm\'s parameters, and the optimization results. In this paper, we use a popular evolutionary algorithm Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to solve service composition problem and focus on the ABC\'s parameter turning issue. The objective is to identify the potential dependency to help service composition algorithm designers easily set up the values of ABC parameters to obtain preferable composition solution without many times of tedious attempts. Five features of service composition problem, three ABC parameters and two metrics of the final solution are identified. Based on a large volume of experiment data, ABC parameter tuning for a given service composition problem is conducted using C4.5 algorithm and the dependency between problem features and ABC parameters are established using multiple linear regression method.

This problem is more complex when dealing with temporal properties of business processes associated with time-dependent QoS parameters that can change according to the execution time. Unlike static QoS which have been deeply studied in the existing service selection approaches, time-dependent QoS are insufficiently taken into consideration. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of service selection to satisfy a given business process while considering temporal properties associated to time-dependent QoS.

Thus, greening web services also becomes an important issue. In this paper, we study the fundamental tradeoff between reliability and energy consumption, and propose an optimization framework that considers both factors. In specific, we build a continuous-time Markov model to analyze the steady-state reliability and mean time to failure (MTTF) from a service-oriented perspective, and obtain the minimum number of service instances to meet the given reliability requirement. Then, we show that deploying these instances in the server cluster to minimize energy consumption is NP-hard. To this end, we propose a heuristic algorithm to approximate the result.

Choosing the most appropriate service from functionally equivalent services is the issue being addressed here. In this paper, we focus on the waiting time of a service request as the criterion for selection.

In this paper, we show how theory of regions, which was originally developed to derive Petri nets from finite state automata, can be applied to find the optimal representation of composition. To apply the theory, we first propose an automaton-based composition framework that incorporates most existing composition techniques without changing the service semantics or its description language. Then based on the special requirements of the composition representation, we develop our own Petri net synthesis algorithm that combines the benefits of two well known algorithms from the theory of regions. We demonstrate that AND/OR workflow nets can limit the concurrency even for simple input/output based service composition, while our Petri net representation is optimal in terms of flexibility and parallelism.

In this paper we focus on automated data flow in Web service composition. The semantic Web, as an evolving extension of the current Web, seems a key initiative to overcome the latter issue. However, even if some approaches focus on discovering potential semantic connections between Web services, few or none of these tackle implementations issues related to XML messages management at syntactic level. In this direction we present an approach for performing automated data flow in Web service composition by i) exploiting semantic matchmaking between Web service parameters (i.e., outputs and inputs) to enable their connection and interaction, and ii) adapting XML database solutions, specifically XML Schema mapping, to perform syntactic data transformation and integration of exchanged messages.

Research has shown that nearly 85% of enterprise data lies in flat filesystems [10] that allow multiple users with different access privileges. Any search tool for such systems needs to be efficient and yet cognizant of access control semantics imposed by the underlying filesystem. Current enterprise search techniques use two disjoint search and access- control components by creating a single system-wide index and filtering search results for access control. This approach is ineffective as index and query statistics subtly leak private information. The other approach of using separate indices for each user is undesirable as it not only increases disk consumption due to shared files, but also increases overheads of updating indices whenever a file changes. We propose a distributed approach that couples search and access-control into a unified framework and pro vides secure multiuser search. Our scheme (logically) divides data into independent access-privileges based chunks, called access-control barrels (ACB). ACBs not only manage security but also improve overall efficiency as they can be indexed and searched in parallel by distributing them to multiple enterprise machines.

Topics and clusters capture the semantic similarity, but rely on mashups that explicitly capture relationships between services. Again, for new services, the information are not readily available.

Traditional methods adopt a fixed set of QoS parameters and typical ones include response time, fee, and availability. There currently lacks an effective way of identifying quality features that users are actually interested in when choosing a service. Meanwhile, the traditional way of collecting QoS values relies on either public information released by service providers or test results from repeatedly invoking a service. Therefore, the values can be heavily affected by authenticity of the provider offered information or the quality/configuration of the test code/environment. As a result, existing QoS evaluation methods are not applicable to subject features, such as usability and affordability, where the values depend on user personal judgement. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extracting domain-related QoS features, ranking those features based on their interestingness, evaluating the value of these features through sentiment analysis on user reviews. More specifically, we leverage natural language processing techniques and machine learning approaches to identify top QoS features that users are interested in and simultaneously learn their sentiment orientation towards those features. We model the problem as sentiment classification, where relevant terms in a review are modeled as features that determine whether a review is positive or negative. Logistic regression is used so that the impact of these terms are learned simultaneously when the classifier is learned through a supervised learning process. The nontrivial terms are selected as the candidate QoS featured.

This work assumes that consumers of services provide to a QoS broker their utility functions and their cost constraints on the requested services. Service providers register with the broker by providing service demands for each of the resources used by the services provided and cost functions for each of the services. Consumers request services from the QoS broker, which selects a service provider that maximizes the consumer\'s utility function subject to its cost constraint. The QoS broker uses analytic queuing models to predict the QoS values of the various services that could be selected under varying workload conditions.

With so many APIs, many management platforms have been developed and deployed, leading to the boom of API markets, that are similar to the mobile App markets. Meanwhile, it has become more and more difficult to select and manage APIs. In reality, most existing management platforms typically recommend currently popular APIs to developers. However, the fact that popularity of API varies over time is ignored in those platforms, leading to the difficulty of recommending APIs that are just released but may be popular in the near future. To tackle this challenge, an approach of predicting the popularity of APIs is proposed in this paper. Predicting the popularity of API can not only be used for API ranking, recommendation and selection, but also make it more convenient for API providers and consumers to manage or select API respectively. In this paper, we propose a time-aware linear model to predict the API popularity, using time series feature of APIs and API\'s self-features such as its\' provider ranking and description features, which are called heterogeneous features in our paper.

Furthermore, the construction of constraints and the selection of services are completely dependent on the literal translation from QoS descriptions, which increase obstacles to actually apply CP.

The UTM provides a latent framework of users, groups, and items by exploiting both the users\' preference profiles and the items\' content information, which together can describe group interests and item features in a more complete manner. This latent framework is then combined with RWR to predict the preference degrees of groups to unrated items by detecting comprehensive latent relationships. In particular, we devised two group-based recommendation algorithms on the basis of different recommendation strategies.

Web-apps have an inherent advantage of platform independent and uniform experience across devices, but the page load time, battery usage, and bandwidth consumption have to be improved. To solve some of these issues, there has been an introduction of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) by content providers. PWA apps use an effective caching policy on web resources based on its property. But the webpages are overwhelmingly non-PWA compliant. There is a need for non-PWA web pages to be effective in bandwidth utilization so that we can avoid the exchange of needless resources.

The web engine then runs the service worker to identify stale web resources which in turn will be helpful to avoid transfer of redundant web resources. The proposed approach was evaluated using top 25 Non-PWA sites from Alexa 100 websites for one month.

However, we may always find that the final solutions contain redundant services that is unnecessary and may cause extra executing costs. Hence, it is significant to remove the redundant services in the service composition process.

People may focus on the optimization of a single QoS criterion or a set of QoS criteria. We find that though many composition algorithms can get the optimal QoS values, the solutions obtained can possibly contain redundant services, the removal of which does not worsen the QoS value of the solution. In the literatures using Web Service Challenge (WSC) open data sets, the removable services can be over 30% of the services in the solutions. This common problem has been ignored so far. The fundamental reason is that execution cost is not one of the criteria to optimize. Even in the cases when execution costs are not explicitly given for each service, we are still motivated to reduce the number of services in the final solution by assuming each service takes unit cost. In this paper, we study the redundancy removal problem to further optimize the QoS optimal solutions obtained by QoS-aware service composition algorithms. We model the redundancy removal problem as an integer programming problem.

Researchers have been trying multiple methods to reveal actual service orchestration patterns from service logs. However, most of the discovery methods have taken deterministic approaches, and hence, they do not provide enough allowance to cater for incomplete data and noises. On the other hand, most investigations do not take combinatorial explosion into consideration leading to scalability problem. Moreover, asynchronous web service invocations and distributed executions also make it difficult to identify service patterns due to the randomness in log record generation. In this paper, probabilistic topic mining class of solutions are applied to reveal web service orchestration patterns from service logs, in which robust approximation methods are available to provide scalability. Data sparsity problem in service log is also investigated by using biterm topic model (BTM) and comparing its results with traditional latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. In addition, a topic matching method is introduced based on the Hungarian method on Jensen-Shannon divergence matrix, whilst notions of aggJSD and autoJSD are also introduced to measure topic diversity between matched topic sets and within a single topic set respectively.

Different from existing user-based collaborative filtering for finding similar users for a target user, instead of searching entire set of users, we concentrate on users physically near to the target user. Similarly, we also modify existing service similarity measurement of collaborative filtering by employing service location information. After finding similar users and services, we use the similarity measurement to predict missing QoS values based on a hybrid collaborative filtering technique.

In this paper, we propose a resilient framework to automatically generate a fault handling strategy for each failed service to improve the efficiency of fault handling. In the framework, we design and implement three components including exception analyzer, decision maker, and strategy selector. First, The exception analyzer builds a record, derived from the system log generated by an application, for each failed service. Next, the decision maker adopts a k-means clustering approach to construct a decision including the fault handling to each failed service in a scope. Then, the strategy selector uses an integer program solver to generate the solution to strategy selection problem that is boiled down to the optimization problem. The experiment shows that the framework can improve resilience of Web service-oriented systems under acceptable overheads, and meanwhile the accuracy of fault handling strategy is over 95%.'),(6010,'conf/icws/VilloldoSL07','Enric Jaén Villoldo||Joan Serrat-Fernández||Emilio Luque','Improving Web Services Interoperability with Binding Extensions.','873-879','2007','conf/icws/2007',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57693912','db/conf/icws/icws2007.html#VilloldoSL07','Salt Lake City, UT','Current Web services are able to interoperate successfully with most basic data types.

The utilization of unreliable data decreases the prediction accuracy greatly. In this paper, we propose a novel credibility-aware QoS prediction method (named CAP) to address this problem.

The deployment of these microservice based applications often requires that every constituent service starts after all its dependencies are configured and running properly. It is also common that these dependencies generate dynamic data that needs to be supplied to other services too at starting time. More complex scenarios require additionally interchanging data in other phases of the microservices lifecycle. One alternative to solve these dependencies is to describe the deployment of microservice applications manually-using scripts-which allows IT operators to precisely define when a service is ready to start serving other components. However, synchronization by scripting is tedious, error prone and hard to maintain. Other solutions offer specific languages to describe service dependencies, along with tool support that interpret scripts in these languages to take care of starting services in the proper order. These tools are either very rich but complex to use, or fail in providing sophisticated ways to describe what it means for a service to be ready. Moreover, the communication layer between services, if supplied, is based on intermediate entities and non-trivial network protocols. This paper proposes pipekit as a solution, by offering a container orchestration language which focuses on simplicity (pipekit is similar to Docker Compose) and is equipped with directives to define when a service is ready. The pipekit tool provides a communication layer for moving data between services, implemented using shared storage. This shared storage provides a very simple interface to move artifacts between services, and greatly simplifies the synchronization logic of pipekit by using semaphores at the file system level.'),(6026,'conf/icws/LeffR15','Avraham Leff||James T.

With the availability of cloud-based storage, many of these enterprises are considering whether and how to make some of this data available on the cloud. One motivation is to offload the processing of new mobile application workloads from the on-premise system to the cloud. Another motivation is to improve the performance of these mobile applications. However, because of the importance of this data, and because of regulatory constraints, many enterprises are unwilling to simply move their data from an on-premise environment to the cloud. Instead, they prefer to keep the \"master\" version of the data on-premise, while projecting a subset of the data to the cloud. Several challenges face these enterprises. First, how can large data-sets be efficiently made available on the cloud with minimal disruption to the ongoing on-premise business function? Second, how can this data be represented in a way that will be useful to cloud developers? Typically, cloud developers want data represented in a way that is easily consumable by REST APIs, but the on-premise representation may not be amenable to such usage.

The proposed method uses a class diagram to represent a domain ontology and sequence or activity diagrams to represent the behavior of a business process. It also uses UML profiles to support various features of OWL-S. Finally, an XMI file extracted from UML diagrams is transformed into an OWL-S ontology via an XSLT script. Experimental results with a large volume of UML diagrams show that the proposed method deals with the control flow of complex processes and is superior to previous methods.'),(6031,'conf/icws/SchallGDD07','Daniel Schall 0001||Robert Gombotz||Christoph Dorn||Schahram Dustdar','Human Interactions in Dynamic Environments through Mobile Web Services.','912-919','2007','conf/icws/2007',NULL,'ICWS',NULL,NULL,'https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q60485900','db/conf/icws/icws2007.html#SchallGDD07','Salt Lake City, UT','In this paper we present the concept of activity-centric collaboration using service-oriented architectures (ACCUSO), which addresses the requirements arising from ad-hoc collaboration in mobile teams.

The possibility to compose activities hierarchically from sub-activities and to redesign running activities provides the process-flexibility required in ad-hoc collaboration. We expand the notion of service orientation by introducing human-provided services (HpS) which provide functionality not realizable through software services.

Therefore, we argue that services should be recommended not individually, but collectively. In this paper, we focus on the problem of recommending service sets instead of services. A service set contains a list of functionally distinct services that collectively match different aspects of functional requirements and are more inclined to compose together following mashup composition patterns.

Monolithic legacy applications in industry undergo a migration to microservice-oriented architectures. A key challenge in this context is the extraction of microservices from existing monolithic code bases. While informal migration patterns and techniques exist, there is a lack of formal models and automated support tools in that area. This paper tackles that challenge by presenting a formal microservice extraction model to allow algorithmic recommendation of microservice candidates in a refactoring and migration scenario. The formal model is implemented in a web-based prototype. A performance evaluation demonstrates that the presented approach provides adequate performance. The recommendation quality is evaluated quantitatively by custom microservice-specific metrics. The results show that the produced microservice candidates lower the average development team size down to half of the original size or lower. Furthermore, the size of recommended microservice conforms with microservice sizing reported by empirical surveys and the domain-specific redundancy among different microservices is kept at a low rate.'),(6075,'conf/icws/ElgazzarHM10','Khalid Elgazzar||Ahmed E.

The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements. Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification. To do so, we reduce the problem of behavioral matching to a graph matching problem and we adapt existing algorithms for this purpose.

Most of the existing researches for this problem are based on the assumption that the tasks involved are independent. However, in practical scenar-ios, the QoS of some candidate services have correlations with other services, which makes the corresponding tasks be correlated with each other. This leads the QoS used to determine the binding relationship between tasks and concrete services to be inaccurate, so the reselected composite service is not the optimal one in the real executing environment for these existing reselection methods. To address this problem, this paper considers task correlations for runtime rebinding. Firstly, the QoS dependencies among services are extracted from the log repository through the APRIORI data mining method. Then, the acquired QoS dependencies are mapped to the tasks correlations by the defined mapping rules. Finally, the reselection process is implemented by making the tasks which have related relationships as a task unit, and the related services of each task unit as its candidate service set.

While such application development mode offers advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and flexibility, application developers cannot understand or deal with risks potentially resulting from vulnerabilities within composed services due to non-transparency of the service providers. Furthermore, some of the vulnerabilities in practice are deeply hidden in dependency structures underlying composed services, thus making even the service providers fail to know the vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a risk-evaluation assisted service selection system, called Risk Evaluation-as-a-Service(or REaaS), which aims to assist application developers to understand vulnerability risks hidden within alternative services when the developers at first attempt to adopt their applications. In particular, for a given application developer\'s service selection requirement, REaaS produces a ranking list based upon vulnerability risks of alternative services to serve as a guideline regarding which service has the lowest potential risks (e.g., Bugs) for this application deployment. REaaS achieves this goal through the following three steps: 1) generating a package dependency graph for each alternative service, 2) assigning threat-degrees to packages in each dependency graph, and 3) analyzing each dependency graph and evaluating service-risk of each service.

As composite Web services are often long-running, loosely coupled and cross-organizational applications, advanced transactional support is required to ensure reliable execution. In addition, in the presence of multiple Web services with equivalent functionality, users will discriminate the alternatives based on their quality of service (QoS). This paper address the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and QoS characteristics defined using a quality model. In this model, Web services are selected in a way that satisfies user preferences.

To enhance reusability, our approach supports separation of adaptation logic from the functional workflow and modularization of workflow tasks in reusable aspects. The main idea is to design a workflow process as a template, where tasks can be specified on an abstract level. Concrete implementations of the tasks, modeled as aspects, are then selected from a library according to a policy-based adaptation logic. This logic is implemented using a general purpose language that offers an extensible and flexible solution to enforce any type of policy.

Verifiable computation enables a computer to offload the computation of some function, to other perhaps untrusted cloud servers, while maintaining verifiable results. The servers evaluate the function and return the result with a proof that the computation of the function was carried out correctly. In the previous setting of verifiable computation, there is only one data provider. But in practice, there exist scenarios such as a network of sensors where each sensor collects data (e.g. air temperature in a certain area of a city) and stores them on servers. A control unit performs computation (e.g. the average air temperature of the city in certain period) on the outsourced data on the cloud (e.g. Amazon Cloud). When the control unit receives the results, it wants to verify the correctness of the computation results returned by the servers. For this scenario, we define a novel two-server multiclient verifiable computation service framework for outsourced data. An efficient construction is proposed, whose security is based on the existence of one-way functions. There are two advantages in our construction: (1) The size of the proof vouching for the correctness of computation result is independent with the number of data providers. (2) The verification only needs two equality tests executed by one who wants to get the computation result.

First, they assume either a single workflow model for the entire event log or the availability of workflow ids that can be used to group logs associated with the same workflow model together. Nonetheless, these assumptions are oversimplified as a complex system typically runs multiple workflow models, all of which share the same log system. Second, existing process mining approaches do not consider the usage patterns of workflow users. Most systems support multi-users and each user is typically associated with (or use) certain number of operation sequences, which may all follow one or several workflow models. Hence, we propose to leverage User Behavior Patterns (or UBPs) to improve the outcome of process mining. In particular, we exploit machine learning techniques to incorporate UBPs into sequence clustering for workflow model discovery. We model a UBP as a probabilistic distribution on sequences, which allows to compute the distance between a UBP and any sequence. We apply three-way matrix factorization onto a UBP-sequence distance matrix to co-cluster users and sequences. In this way, users that share similar UBPs are grouped together while the clustering of similar sequences will lead to the discovery of workflow models.

In the era of Web 2.0, companies worldwide are actively deploying Web services within their business environments. As a result, designing effective Web service recommendation mechanisms based on Quality of Service (QoS) is attracting more attention. However, traditional Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) models fail to capture the actual relationships between users or services due to data sparsity. On the other hand, Random Walk (RW) algorithm, which has been categorized as a sparsity-tolerant recommendation approach, suffers from poor performance in terms of recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we aim at designing a recommendation model that achieves high recommendation accuracy over the transitional RW based model. First, we propose an Integrated-Model QoS-based Graph (IMQG), in which users and services represent the nodes while weighted QoS magnitudes and User/Service similarity measurements serve as the edges. We use Jaccard coefficient in several variants to separately compute similarities of both Users and Services. Then, Top-k Random Walk algorithm is applied to generate final recommendation list to active users. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, comprehensive experiments are conducted on a real-world QoS dataset. Analysis of the results shows high improvement in recommendation accuracy with more tolerance to data sparsity.'),(6142,'conf/icws/WombacherFN04','Andreas Wombacher||Peter Fankhauser||Erich J.

During model extraction, the original structure of the service composition cannot be preserved and backwards traceability of the verification findings is not possible.

Structure preservation is feasible, due to the formally grounded expressiveness properties of BIP. As a proof of concept, we apply the developed embedding to a sample BPEL program and present the analysis results for a safety property. By exploiting the BIP model structure we interpret the analysis findings in terms of the service interactions stated in the BPEL source code.

Unfortunately, services at the cold-start stage, prior to being rated, face the rating scarcity problem. In this paper, we focus on this problem and address it through a novel reputation model that uses the Elo algorithm to consider consumer-implicit information in a graph analysis approach. A theoretical analysis is conducted to identify the sufficient and necessary condition for the model to converge to a stable state. Furthermore, experiments confirm our model outperforms the widely adopted reputation algorithm in both accuracy and convergence in the situation of rating scarcity.'),(6853,'conf/IEEEscc/HuFHC15','Xiaocao Hu||Zhiyong Feng||Keman Huang||Shizhan Chen','Classification Based Parameter Association for Non-redundant Annotation.','688-695','2015','conf/IEEEscc/2015',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2015.98','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2015.html#HuFHC15','New York, NY','Semantic annotation of Web Services can facilitate the automated service discovery and composition. At present, however, many solutions suffer from redundant annotations or imprecise derived annotations. The fundamental task to address the issue is to find parameters that have same semantics in a large number of Web Services. This paper proposes a classification based approach for identifying parameters that are semantically equivalent, laying the foundation for non-redundant annotation. Subsequently the paper presents the non-redundant annotation, in which the parameter space is firstly reduced, and then semantic annotation is performed on the reduced parameter space, finally annotation results of the reduced parameter space are expanded to the original parameter space. To evaluate the final annotation results, the paper gives a methodology based on service discovery. The experimental results indicate that the parameter association approach can achieve outstanding accuracy in identifying the equivalence between parameters. Moreover, it is suggested that the non-redundant annotation can greatly reduce redundant annotations, and can augment the semantics of Web Services with adequate accuracy, which can achieve similar performance in service discovery as OWL-S services do.'),(6855,'conf/IEEEscc/AggarwalADSE16','Vishalaksh Aggarwal||Shivali Agarwal||Gaargi Banerjee Dasgupta||Giriprasad Sridhara||Vijay E','ReAct: A System for Recommending Actions for Rapid Resolution of IT Service Incidents.','1-8','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.134','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#AggarwalADSE16','San Francisco, CA','In this paper, we present a system called ReAct which, given a problem/incident description, helps the service agents to easily identify set of actions and the possible action sequence to resolve the issue mentioned in the ticket.

Despite the hype for microservitization , the state of the art still lacks consensus on the definition of microservices, their properties and their modelling techniques. This paper summarises views of microservices from informal literature to reflect on the foundational context of this paradigm shift. A strong foundational context can advance our understanding of microservitization and help guide software architects in addressing its design problems. One such design problem is finalising the optimal level of granularity of a microservice architecture. Related design trade-offs include: balancing the size and number of microservices in an architecture and balancing the nonfunctional requirement satisfaction levels of the individual microservices as well as their satisfaction for the overall system. We propose how self-adaptivity can assist in addressing these design trade-offs and discuss some of the challenges such a selfadaptive solution.

To expose, evaluate, and ultimately manage these risk/benefit trade-offs, we generalize the replication strategy by: (a) accounting for the possible inefficiency of \"remote\" service, (b) allowing replication only when static routing fails to identify an idle \"local\" server, and (c) requiring one or more replicas of the same request to be completed to improve fault tolerance using a majority rule decision.

A number of Internet service providers, such as Google and Baidu, entered this emerging market and developed a variety of cloud storage services. These ubiquitous services allow people to access personal files all over the world at anytime. With the prevalence of mobile Internet and rich media on web, more and more people use cloud storage for storing working documents, music, private photos and movies. Nevertheless, the size of the media files is often beyond the upper limit that a normal form-based file upload allows hence dedicated large-file upload services are required to be developed. Although various cloud vendors offer versatile cloud storage services, very little is known about the detailed development and deployment of the large-file upload services. This paper proposes a complete solution of large-file upload service, with the contributions in manyfold: Firstly, we do not limit the maximum size of a large file that can be uploaded. This is extremely practical to store huge database files from ERP tools. Secondly, we developed large-file upload service APIs that have very strict verification of correctness, to reduce the risk of data inconsistency. Thirdly, we extends the service developed recently for team collaboration with the capability of handling large files. Fourthly, this paper is arguably the first one that formalizes the testing and deployment procedures of large-file upload services with the help of Docker. In general, most large-file upload services are exposed to the public, facing security and performance issues, which brings much concern. With the proposed Docker-based deployment strategy, we can replicate the large-file upload service agilely and locally, to satisfy massive private or local deployment of KDrive.

In practice, prior knowledge from human\'s trajectory of utilizing Web services could be helpful in improving the accuracy of Web services clustering. With an analysis in the dataset of Web services and Mashups from ProgrammableWeb, we observe that Web services Mashuped together are highly likely to belong to different clusters and Web services being annotated with identical tags tend to be within the same cluster. Based on these observations, this paper proposes an efficient clustering approach for Web services. The approach firstly uses a probabilistic topic model to elicit the latent topic vectors from Web service description documents. It then performs clustering based on the K-means++ algorithm by incorporating parameters representing above mentioned prior knowledge. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted to validate the performance of our proposed approach based on a ground truth dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb.

It often becomes challenging for an individual to effectively analyze the large scale scientific data of relatively higher complexity and dimensions, and requires a collaboration of multiple members of different disciplines. Hence, researchers have focused on designing collaborative workflow management systems. However, consistency management in the face of conflicting concurrent operations of the collaborators is a major challenge in such systems. In this paper, we propose a locking scheme (e.g., collaborator gets write access to non-conflicting components of the workflow at a given time) to facilitate consistency management in collaborative scientific workflow management systems. The proposed method allows locking workflow components at a granular level in addition to supporting locks on a targeted part of the collaborative workflow. We conducted several experiments to analyze the performance of the proposed method in comparison to related existing methods. Our studies show that the proposed method can reduce the average waiting time of a collaborator by up to 36.19% in comparison to existing descendent modular level locking techniques for collaborative scientific workflow management systems.'),(6969,'conf/IEEEscc/HalimaKGJ17','Rania Ben Halima||Slim Kallel||Walid Gaaloul||Mohamed Jmaiel','Optimal Cost for Time-Aware Cloud Resource Allocation in Business Process.','314-321','2017','conf/IEEEscc/2017',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2017.47','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2017.html#HalimaKGJ17','Honolulu, HI','Cloud Computing infrastructures are being increasingly used for running business process activities due to its high performance level and low operating cost.

Moreover, using current technology to discover proper semantic services for a composite service is time-consuming and inaccurate. To deal with these problems, we proposed a Web service similarities measurement method and a recommendation method.

Moreover, it remains a difficult task for users to specify queries that perfectly reflect their requirements due to the lack of knowledge of their expected service functionalities. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented service discovery approach, which aims to obtain accurate RESTful services for user functional goals.

In this paper, a QoS-aware adaptive routing (QAR) is proposed in the designed multi-layer hierarchical SDNs. Specifically, the distributed hierarchical control plane architecture is employed to minimize signaling delay in large SDNs via three-levels design of controllers, i.e., the super, domain (or master), and slave controllers. Furthermore, QAR algorithm is proposed with the aid of reinforcement learning and QoS-aware reward function, achieving a time-efficient, adaptive, QoS-provisioning packet forwarding.

Therefore, both reliability requirements and delay constraints should be taken into account.

In this paper, we consider the problem of reliable multiservice delivery in which the source node performs rate control and routing selection based on availability statistics at individual sensors. We model the problem using network utility maximization and incorporate availability estimates into the NUM formulation (ANUM) with delay constraints.

The QoS properties such as response time, reliability and latency of these services are important factors to decide which services to select. As we know, the energy consumption is becoming a big issue as a result of IT expansion. Therefore, establishing a QoS-based web service selection approach that considers energy consumption as one of the essential QoS properties represents a significant step towards selecting the greener web service. This paper presents an experimental study of energy consumption and latency behavior of data mining algorithms running as web services. Our study shows that, there is a strong relation between the dataset properties such as dataset size, number of attributes, data type, and QoS attributes energy consumption and latency. Based on the findings from our study, a prediction system is built which can be used to predict the energy consumption and latency values for data mining web services on a given dataset, and then these services can be ranked according to their predicted energy and latency values.

The APP is becoming increasingly large, and MicroService architecture has become the choice of many APP developers. However, the users\' process of obtaining service is becoming tedious while using the APP that integrated various MicroServices, and there are no interactions among MicroServices. Users often install many APPs on their mobile devices. Facing some complex user requirements which go beyond the boundary of a single service, how to find the appropriate services and compose them becomes a critical issue. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a client-based MicroServices automatic collaboration(MSAC) framework. First, we build a fine-grained APP automatic collaboration meta-model, including a MicroService model and a collaboration model, to formally describe the issue of MSAC. Based on the meta-model, we develop a Micro Servitization tool to decompose the APP into client-based MicroServices that support the automatic collaboration and encapsulate them as normalized interfaces.

The maximum degree of parallelism a workflow can reach during its execution is usually defined at design time. However, designing workflow models capable to provide an efficient use of distributed computing platforms is not a simple task and requires specialized expertise. Furthermore, since Workflow Management Systems see workflow activities as black-boxes, they are not able to automatically explore data parallelism in the workflow execution. To address this problem, in this work we propose a novel method to automatically improve data parallelism in workflows based on annotations that characterize how activities access and consume data. For an annotated workflow model, the method defines a model transformation and a database setup (including data sharding, replication, and indexing) to support data parallelism in a distributed environment. To evaluate this approach, we implemented and tested two workflows that process up to 20.5 million data objects from real-world datasets. We executed each model in 21 different scenarios in a cluster on a public cloud, using a centralized relational database and a distributed NoSQL database.

Therefore, effects of business relationships must be analysed in the service selection process. This research proposes a composite service selection approach with the full consideration of business relationships. A formal business rule description language is defined to describe various types of business relationships and their effects on QoS.

However, most of them assume that the users\' QoS requirements are deterministic and different QoS dimensions of the requirements are independent of each other. In fact, correlations may exist between different QoS dimensions of users\' QoS requirements, which make existing service selection approaches impractical. In this paper, we propose SCORE-QoS (Service Selection based on Correlated QoS Requirements), in which the correlated QoS requirements are represented with QoS correlation functions and integrated into the Constraint Optimization Problem that models the service selection process.

Although the existing infrastructure-based approaches can solve this problem partially, they require a high initial investment and maintenance cost.

A more economically feasible solution is using crowdsourcing-based approaches where a user near a free parking spot informs the interested users about the available parking spot in exchange for some forms of incentives. However, most of the crowdsourced approaches suffer due to the lack of proper models for price negotiation, information verification, and assurance.

ParkBid determines the incentives for providing any parking information based on several primitives, such as time, location, reputation, urgency, etc. Along with a detailed discussion about the challenges in ParkBid for both the users and information providers, we provide a set of policies as countermeasures.

These models are usually created and evolved independently by different stakeholders and consequently deviations occur among models such as message not received and incompatible behaviours. It is therefore crucial to detect and resolve the deviations before actual implementation and deployment is undertaken. This paper presents a containment checking approach that verifies whether the behaviour (or interactions) described by the local choreography models collectively encompasses those specified in the global model. Previous studies have not considered the containment relationship between global and local choreography models.

Concept drift detection of business processes is one of the most critical problems in process mining. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches use statistical hypothesis testing for change point detection by sliding-window-based analysis and feature extraction, which suffer from bad performance and missed detection of certain types of changes. To attack such challenges, this paper proposes a framework as well as detailed models and techniques for online process concept drift detection without any feature extraction. A streaming scheme is presented to detect, locate, and classify the concept drifts simultaneously without requiring any storage of the event traces that have been analyzed. Four types of process concept drifts which are sudden drift, gradual drift, recurring drift, and incremental drift can be precisely discovered, and noise as well as flexibility in business processes are fully considered. The efficacy of the approach is also validated by simulation experiments on large-scale business process event streams.'),(7203,'conf/IEEEscc/WuZ16','Zhengping Wu||Yu Zhou','Service Trustworthiness Evaluation Using Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic.','563-570','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.80','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#WuZ16','San Francisco, CA','Trustworthiness has become a critical factor for users to choose the most suitable computing services for business or personal use.

Specifically, it computes a seller\'s reputation profile to indicate his/her dynamic trustworthiness in different product categories, price ranges, time periods, and any necessary combination of them. Then, in order to promptly answer a buyer\'s requests on the results of CTT computation, CMK-tree has been designed to appropriately index the precomputed aggregation results over large-scale ratings and transaction data. Nevertheless, CMK-tree requires additional storage space. In practice, a seller usually has a large volume of transactions. Moreover, with significant increase of historical transaction data (e.g., Over one or two years), the size of storage space consumed by CMK-tree will become much larger. In reducing storage space consumption for CTT computation, the aggregation results that are generated based on the ratings and transaction data from remote history, e.g., \"12 months ago\" can be deleted, as the ratings from remote history are less important for evaluating a seller\'s recent behavior. However, to achieve nearly linear and robust query performance, the deletion operations in the CMK-tree become complicated. In this paper, we propose three deletion strategies for CTT computation based on CMK-tree. With our proposed deletion strategies, the additional storage space consumption can be restricted to a limited range, which offers great benefit to trust management with millions of sellers. Finally, we have conducted experiments to illustrate both advantages and disadvantages of the proposed deletion strategies.'),(7210,'conf/IEEEscc/TeabeTH16a','Boris Teabe||Alain Tchana||Daniel Hagimont','Mitigating Performance Unpredictability in Heterogeneous Clouds.','593-600','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.83','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#TeabeTH16a','San Francisco, CA','The speed of a device may vary since (i) IaaS hardware infrastructures are increasingly heterogeneous and (ii) devices often have a dynamically adjusted speed in order to adapt their energy consumption according to the load.

Due to the dynamic and uncertain system performance, failures of on-time completion, namely temporal violations, often take place during workflow runtime and thus temporal verification and temporal violation handling are required. Currently, workflow throughput is employed by temporal verification for a large number of parallel workflow instances as the detector for temporal violations in a collective way. However, based on workflow throughput, it is impossible to locate the exact workflow activities and cloud services where temporal violations occurred. This is a critical problem as to increase workflow throughput of the whole system is very expensive if we do not know where to fix local temporal violations. To address such a problem, based on the results of a throughput based temporal checkpoint selection strategy, this paper proposes a novel temporal violation handling point selection strategy which further utilizes the average response time of a cloud service as the key detector to determine whether temporal violation handling needs to be implemented or not. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that while achieving the same on-time completion rate, our strategy is much more cost effective as it can precisely localize temporal violations and hence require a much smaller number of times for temporal violation handling compared with other strategies.'),(7257,'conf/IEEEscc/NaimAQD16','Hafida Naim||Mustapha Aznag||Mohamed Quafafou||Nicolas Durand 0001','Semantic Divergence Based Evaluation of Web Service Communities.','736-743','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.101','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#NaimAQD16','San Francisco, CA','The number of community detection algorithms is growing continuously adopting a topological based approach to discover optimal subgraphs or communities.

Further statistical attribute values such as confidence interval, quantile value, extreme case possibility, etc. can also be used for ranking and identifying potential straggler nodes within the cluster.

Our paper assumes a cloud provider whose services are operated on a minimal number of dedicated servers in a datacenter, we also assume that this provider delivers software as a service (SaaS). In order to reduce the number of dedicated servers that could be comatose, we propose to automatically generate and run auto-tuning tasks that, in servers idle time, will learn to calibrate the execution of the software delivered by the provider. Our proposition follows the goal of delivering auto-tuning as an opportunistic cloud-service. For this purpose we introduce an opportunistic auto-tuning service (QTuning) that exploits servers idle time. The service is based on a theoretical model that includes two computational problems: an exploration and exploitation problem. In the former problem, the goal is to evaluate the performance of a software in different configurations. In the latter, assuming a set of performance results for a given software, the goal is to compute the best configurations to run the software with.

Service Composition consists of four stages: planning, discovery, selection, and execution. Web service discovery and selection are becoming challenging and time-consuming tasks due to large number of Web services available on the internet. Organizing Web services into clusters of similar services to aid the pruning of the query space is one of the solutions for the issues. Web services can be clustered into similar groups by considering functional attributes to increase the performance of the service discovery. In selection stage, algorithm has to select a single service among the large number of functional equal services by considering the Quality of Service (QoS) values. In this paper, we propose QoS aware service clustering approach to increase the performance of the service selection. Here, service clusters are created using functionality as the first factor, then QoS properties being considered as secondary factors.

We consider the special case where the processing of requests submitted to such services consists of: the querying of several types of sub-services followed by the composition of the output produced the sub-services. This could be the case for instance of a booking service that proposes travel packs including: hotel reservation, car rental and flight booking. We propose to improve the quality of such services with the multi-selection problem. The goal in this problem is to select the subset of sub-services of each type to use in the the processing of search request. The selection must ensure that we maximize the quality of the results we could expect from the search. The multi-selection problem is close to the service selection problem. However, while in the latter, we are interested in a unique sub-service per type, in the former, we want to choose a subset of sub-services.

Quality of Service (QoS) is a key criterion for the choice of optimal Web services from a set of candidate Web services with similar functions. However, QoS data is acquired through the invocation of services from users. Thus, QoS prediction is critical for building high-quality service-oriented applications. Since QoS is highly related to dynamic factors such as users\' or services\' status and network environments which are variable over time, it is an important task to predict the unknown QoS values at runtime. In addition, the factors which cause the change of QoS may be various, such as the influence of noise, the change of the network environments. Prediction without taking account of these factors will affect the prediction accuracy. To address the problems above, we propose an online prediction approach for dynamic QoS (OPA-DQ). OPA-DQ extends matrix factorization into an online approach to make the QoS prediction process more efficient. According to the analysis on the factors which will cause the change of QoS, we build a series of processes to make better QoS prediction performance.

We then use game theory to analyse the Bayes-Nash equilibrium bidding strategies of service providers and consumers on the web service.

We show that when the cloud platform sets the uniform market equilibrium price as the service price for all matched service providers and consumers, they will bid close to their valuations on the services. However, when the cloud platform sets discriminatory prices for each matched pair of provider and consumer, service providers will ask more than their valuations and consumers will bid less than their valuations.

The reason is that cloud systems, besides inheriting all the vulnerabilities of the traditional computing systems, appeal to new types of threats engendered mainly by the virtualization concept that allows multiple users\' virtual machines (VMs) to share a common computing platform. This broadens the attack space of the malicious users and increases their ability to attack both the cloud system and other co-resident VMs. Motivated by the absence of any approach that addresses the problem of optimal detection load distribution in the domain of cloud computing, we develop a resource-aware maxmin game theoretical model that guides the hypervisor on how the detection load should be optimally distributed among its guest VMs in the real-time. The objective is to maximize the hypervisor\'s probability of detection, knowing that the attacker is dividing the attack over several VMs to minimize this probability. Experimental results on Amazon EC2 pricing dataset reveal that our model increases the probability of detecting distributed attacks, reduces the false positives, and minimizes the resources wasted during the detection process.'),(7474,'conf/IEEEscc/EscoffierL15','Clément Escoffier||Philippe Lalanda','Managing the Heterogeneity and Dynamism in Hybrid Mobile Applications.','74-81','2015','conf/IEEEscc/2015',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2015.20','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2015.html#EscoffierL15','New York, NY','Today, the proliferation of mobile devices coupled with the widespread availability of the Internet is opening up new service opportunities in numerous areas.

The cost concept can also include time, usability, and maintenance. Cost of a Web service can be estimated by identifying the attributes of cost from the perspective of different stakeholders such as Web service provider, Web service consumer, Web service repository moderator, and Web service policy maker. In addition, analyzing different roles in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) will further provide more knowledge about different perspectives of cost concepts in SOA. This paper addresses the essential attributes of estimating cost of a Web service. Moreover, this paper specifies attributes of measuring CoS, defines these attributes, and defines metrics and units of these attributes.

From a transactional equivalence perspective a method to minimize the target business transactions model and improve the verification efficiency is presented. This work proposes a formal modeling method for a flexible transaction based on an extension of Pi-calculus. An operational semantics is defined as an extension of the classical one for Pi-calculus by introducing membrane activities (a kind of wrapper for processes). Then, a weak bisimulation relation is defined, which is used to reduce the transaction models and apply checking transactions equivalence.

The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus \"i\" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.'),(7747,'conf/IEEEscc/HuangPF16','Hua Huang 0006||Rong Peng||Zaiwen Feng','A Time-Aware Method to Process Behavioral Similarity Calculation.','395-402','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.58','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#HuangPF16','San Francisco, CA','Process behavioral similarity calculation is widely used in many activities of business process management, such as process mining, process clustering and process retrieval. However, most existing process behavioral similarity measurement methods do not consider variable constraints (e.g. time constraints) in process models. Since the variable constraints of tasks, especially time constraints, are crucial to quantify the differences between the executions of tasks with the same or similar labels in process models, it is significant to calculate exact process behavioral similarity with the consideration of their impacts in process models. In this paper, we formally define the process behavioral similarity with time constraints and propose a time-aware method to efficiently compute the process behavioral similarity based on the ordering relations with time constraints.

To address this, providers need to gain insights about customer satisfaction. In that regards, support ticket data, understood as the main way of communication between both parties, can be mined to obtain an estimation of customer satisfaction by means of the polarity of the sentiment extracted from the report descriptions. To that end, in this work we propose a model which can learn a feature representation for sentiment polarity changes, from the sequence of tickets emitted by a given customer during the period associated with the service subscription term. Then, that resulting feature representation, combined with other handcrafted features related to contract and ticket data, is passed to a classifier which estimates the likelihood of service subscription renewal by the customer. Experiment results using real data from a service provider shows that learned representation of sentiment polarity changes from support ticket data in combination with other handcrafted features improves the accuracy in predicting subscription renewals. Moreover, our architecture is flexible enough incorporate and integrate several feature representations and give more expressive power to the prediction.'),(7756,'conf/IEEEscc/XuWCW17','Jingmin Xu||Yuan Wang||Pengfei Chen||Ping Wang','Lightweight and Adaptive Service API Performance Monitoring in Highly Dynamic Cloud Environment.','35-43','2017','conf/IEEEscc/2017',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2017.80','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2017.html#XuWCW17','Honolulu, HI','Cloud platforms and services usually provide an APIlayer as decoupled, language agnostic interface for both front-end client integration and back-end data and/or function access.

However, the extreme dynamics, complexity and scale of the current cloud platforms challenge the applicability of the existing performance monitoring and anomaly detection approaches from timeliness, accuracy, and scalability perspectives. This paper presents a novel approach to API performance monitoring,which recognizes performance problems by response time deviation from a baseline response time / throughput model that are created and continuously updated through online learning.

We have evaluated the performance of containers in terms of inter-container (caused by two concurrent executing containers) and intra-container (caused between two microservices executing inside a container) interference which is almost neglected in the current literature.

Many monitoring tools have been proposed to report compliance with the SLA. However, they have some limitations when changes to monitoring requirements must be made and because of the complexity involved in capturing low-level raw data from services at runtime. In this paper, we propose the design of a platform-independent monitoring middleware for cloud services, which supports the monitoring of SLA compliance and provides a report containing SLA violations that may help stakeholders to make decisions regarding how to improve the quality of cloud services. Moreover, our middleware definition is based on the use of models@run.time, which allows the dynamic change of quality requirements and/or the dynamic selection of different metric operationalizations (i.e., Calculation formulas) with which to measure the quality of services. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we show the instantiation of the proposed middleware that can be used to monitor services when deployed on the Microsoft Azure© platform.'),(7808,'conf/IEEEscc/BelguithK0R18','Sana Belguith||Nesrine Kaaniche||Mohamed Mohamed 0001||Giovanni Russello','C-ABSC: Cooperative Attribute Based SignCryption Scheme for Internet of Things Applications.','245-248','2018','conf/IEEEscc/2018',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2018.00040','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2018.html#BelguithK0R18','San Francisco','In this paper, we present C-ABSC, a cooperative privacy preserving attribute based signcryption mechanism.

Consequently, contemporary Cloud threat analyses approaches primarily focus on specific services/layers without analyzing the malicious behaviors over the complete multi-layered Cloud ecosystem. Hence, the need is of a comprehensive Cloud threat analysis approach that can (a) analyze the spectrum of malicious behaviors stemming from the vulnerable service interactions across the multi-level operational stack, and (b) correspondingly enumerate the attack surface exploitability by varied types of attackers.

Initially two non-functional features were monitored: response time and availability. The prediction is based on services historical data that are analyzed by a fuzzy system. With this prediction, there is a self-configuration on the system that changes service priority, making the provider processes high priority before low priority services. This prediction also helps the self-optimization of the system. It can be observed by the decrease of average response time and by the increase of average availability. It is not always possible to predict a failure, and after a failure, the system is capable of self-healing using recovering actions. Results show improvements of e-contracts accomplishments.

In virtualized cloud, virtual machines (VMs) are the basis for allocating resources. A VM is launched with a fixed allocated computing capacity that should be strictly provided by the hosting system scheduler. Unfortunately, this allocated capacity is not always respected, due to mechanisms provided by the virtual machine monitoring system (also known as hypervisor). For instance, we observe that a significant amount of CPU is consumed by the underlying system components. This consumed CPU time is not only difficult to monitor, but also is not charged to VM capacities. Consequently, we have VMs using more computing capacities than the allocated values. Such a situation can lead to performance unpredictability for cloud clients, and resources waste for the cloud provider. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a mechanism which solves this issue.

Thus, a knowledge map consisting of a summary of individual services and their relations has become increasingly useful. There are two challenges in building such a knowledge graph for Web service ecosystems. First, services keep evolving in terms of function and usage pattern, while their descriptions typically remain static and obsolete. Second, service profiles usually comprise some common background terms which do not differentiate services. To address the two challenges, we developed a novel tailored topic model, named Service Representation-LDA (SR-LDA), to mine effective representations beyond service profiles to build a knowledge map. The key idea is to incorporate mashup descriptions as an indication of service evolution, and introduce a global filter to identify and filter out background terms. Extensive experiments show that the tailored model is more effective than baselines. The methodology of building knowledge maps for the real-world ProgrammableWeb service ecosystem based on the learned representations is also presented, together with the analyses of representative functionality patterns.'),(7958,'conf/IEEEscc/LalandaHHV17','Philippe Lalanda||Rania Ben Hadj||Catherine Hamon||Germán Vega','Conflict Management in Service-Oriented Pervasive Platforms.','249-256','2017','conf/IEEEscc/2017',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2017.39','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2017.html#LalandaHHV17','Honolulu, HI','Smart Home solutions are currently booming and apply to a variety of areas in order to improve inhabitants\' quality of life.

To provide this trust, we propose a BPaaS configuration method that allows clients to ensure their transactional requirements will not be violated, while configuring the activities, resources, and data objects used in the service. Clients formalize transactional requirements using an expressive and easy-to-use template set.

Since today\'s business partners are scattered across the globe, the workflows are executed in a highly distributed and heterogeneous environment. Those environments are, however, failure-prone and, thus, providing availability is not trivial. In this work, we improve availability by replicating workflow executions, while ensuring that the outcome is the same as in a non-replicated execution. For making workflow replication easily usable with current workflow technology, we derive the requirements for modeling a workflow replication system.

However, it is not easy to determine how much resources are required to satisfy consumers expectations in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Some existing frameworks provide mechanisms to adapt the required cloud resources in the service delivery, also called an elastic service, but only for consumers with the same QoS expectations. The problem arises when the service provider must deal with several consumers, each demanding a different QoS for the service. In such an scenario, cloud resources provisioning must deal with trade-offs between different QoS, while fulfilling these QoS, within the same service deployment. In this paper we propose an elasticity-aware governance platform for cloud service delivery that reacts to the dynamic service load introduced by consumers demand. Such a reaction consists of provisioning the required amount of cloud resources to satisfy the different QoS that is offered to the consumers by means of several service level agreements. The proposed platform aims to keep under control the QoS experienced by multiple service consumers while maintaining a controlled cost.'),(7983,'conf/IEEEscc/DelgadoGR16','Andrea Delgado||Laura González 0001||Raúl Ruggia','A Process-Aware Inter-organizational Service Integration Platform to Support Collaborative Organizations.','844-847','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.120','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#DelgadoGR16','San Francisco, CA','Organizations sharing common goals are required to integrate their software systems in order set up collaborative business processes (BPs).

We demonstrate two new attacks, identity shadowing and the Man-in-the-Loop (MITL) attacks, which are applicable in particular to multiparty collaborative environments. In this paper, we propose MIDEP, a Multiparty Identity Establishment Protocol for collaborative environments. The proposed protocol allows a client to establish a secure, multiparty, probabilistic, temporal, verifiable, and non-traceable public identity with the collaborating peers in a decentralized architecture. MIDEP allows a client to avoid identity shadowing and protects the service from the resulting threats as well as from colluded information sharing among the collaborating peers. We illustrate how existing collaborative service frameworks can utilize MIDEP to securely establish the public identity prior to beginning the service session.

Such rule-based systems do not perform well in scenarios, where human generated rules cannot adapt to dynamic variations in the data distribution arising due to dynamic changes in the environment, especially if data dimensionality is very high. Examples of such scenarios exist wherever the sensed data arrives from the physical world - such as weather data, physical sensor data, human behaviour controlled data, etc. Clearly, to meet the adaptivity requirements of such scenarios we require the agents to possess adaptive reasoning capability such that they can adapt the underlying rules with respect to the changing environment.

To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation.

Considering their relevance, it is essential that these attributes are precisely defined. Moreover, as quality attributes are inherently dynamic, they must be continuously monitored. In this context, this paper proposes a meta-model that formally defines and connects service, quality and event domains. From one perspective, the connection between service and quality domains enables the design of models that formally specify applications\' functional and non-functional requirements.

Thus, they need to be converted to semantic rules that can be understood by the search engine of the manufacturing ontologies. Manually converting service rules to semantic rules is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposed an approach that automatically converts service rules to semantic rules. The proposed scheme classifies the semantics of typical service rules into several semantic categories.

For example, TIMES World University Rankings can be used as a reference when choosing a college. However, in the numerous factors that affect objects ranking, people have their own understanding on the effect of each factor on objects ranking.

The challenge of rule composition is amplified in the environment of distributed model driven development for web service-based systems where redundant information/data is emphasized. The same redundant information can be expressed in different forms that comprise various topological structures for entity relationship networks representing the same part of the system.

We evaluate our approach on benchmark services and the results show that the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are higher than those of a state-of-the-art service-organization approach, while a low total number of pragmatics is greedily stored by our approach.'),(8167,'conf/IEEEscc/IvakiLA15','Naghmeh Ivaki||Nuno Laranjeiro||Filipe Araújo','A Design Pattern for Reliable HTTP-Based Applications.','656-663','2015','conf/IEEEscc/2015',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2015.94','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2015.html#IvakiLA15','New York, NY','HTTP is currently being used as the communication protocol for many applications on the web, supporting business and safety-critical services throughout the world. Despite the growing importance, HTTP-based applications are quite exposed to network failures, which can bring in huge losses to the service users and providers, including financial and reputation losses. Several approaches try to achieve reliable communication by using logging and retransmission of whole HTTP messages, which is especially ill-adapted to large messages. Stream-based approaches are more efficient as, upon failure, they transparently resume data transmission from where it stopped. Despite this, designing a stream-based mechanism involves significant challenges, as it is very difficult to know how much data is lost due to failure. In this paper we propose a stream-based mechanism for reliable HTTP communication that is entirely based on HTTP messages and is compatible with existing software. The mechanism is presented as a design pattern and relieves developers from explicitly handling connection failures, providing a standard way for building more reliable applications. Results show that the mechanism is functional, compatible with legacy applications, and that the coding and runtime costs of this design pattern are quite low.'),(8168,'conf/IEEEscc/GhoshGCBD16','Rahul Ghosh||Avantika Gupta||Soumi Chattopadhyay||Ansuman Banerjee||Koustuv Dasgupta','CoCOA: A Framework for Comparing Aggregate Client Operations in BPO Services.','539-546','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.76','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#GhoshGCBD16','San Francisco, CA','Operational efficiency is a major indicator by which the profitability of a business process outsourcing (BPO) service is evaluated. To measure such operational efficiency, BPO service providers define and monitor a set of key performance indicators (KPI) (e.g., productivity of employees, turn-around-time). While a pair of clients can be directly compared using a KPI, comparing the aggregate client operations across multiple KPIs is non-trivial. This is primarily because KPIs are disparate in nature (e.g., cost is measured in dollar while turn-around-time is measured in minutes). In this paper, we present CoCOA, a framework that compares aggregate operations of clients in BPO services so that they can be viewed in a single pane of glass. Two key modules of CoCOA are: (a) client rank aggregator and (b) KPI importance classifier. For a given time period, the rank aggregator module determines an aggregate ranking of clients using variety of inputs (e.g., individual KPI rank, priority of a KPI). When the aggregate rank of a client deteriorates over successive time periods, KPI importance classifier identifies the responsible KPIs for such deterioration. Thus, CoCOA not only helps in comparing the aggregate operation of clients, but also provides prescriptive analytics for improving organizational performance for a given client. We evaluate our approach using anonymized data set collected from a real BPO business and show how responsible KPIs can be identified when there is a deterioration in aggregate client rank.'),(8179,'conf/IEEEscc/SiriweeraPK17','T.

A non-trivial challenge for a service assembler is in deciding the set of information providers to subscribe to, given the heterogeneity in the offerings provided, the economics of the business model, the target set of customers in the market place and most importantly, the profit margin.

Unfortunately, current solutions either only provide limited streaming analysis capacity and horizontal scalability (classic RDBMS) or trade off transaction processing for other properties (NoSQL DBMS), leading to the curse of no \"one size fits all\" for DBMS.

Traditional approaches for service provisioning are usually not directly adaptable to the mobile environments owing to the latter\'s dynamic and distinct nature. Hence, in this paper a lightweight and extensible approach for service description especially designed for mobile environments is proposed. The proposed approach incorporates detailed and rich descriptions covering functional, non-functional, contextual, and business aspects of services to be provisioned over mobile devices. The service descriptions have been partitioned along these lines and the various parts are distributed between service registries and the mobile service providers. This facilitates the service provider to maintain an up-to-date description without having to compromise on the overall consistency of the description. The proposed service description is good for a heterogeneous environment comprising both wired and wireless systems.

It is commonly used in data analytics services, such as processing Twitter tweets. Current stream processing frameworks boast high throughput and low average latency. However, lower tail latencies and better real-time performance are desirable to stream processing users. In practice, there are issues that can affect the performance of these applications and cause unacceptable violations of real-time constraints. Some examples of these issues are garbage collection pauses and resource contention. In this paper, we propose applying redundancy in the data processing pipeline to increase the resiliency of stream processing applications to timing errors. This results in better real-time performance and a reduction in tail latency. We present a methodology and apply this redundancy in a framework based on Twitter\'s Heron. Then, we then evaluate the effectiveness of this technique against a range of injected timing errors using benchmarks from Intel\'s Storm Benchmark. Furthermore, we also study the potential effects of duplication when applied at different stages in the topology. Finally, we evaluate the additional overhead that duplicating tuples brings to a stream processing topology. Our results show that redundant tuple processing can effectively reduce the tail latency by up to 63% and that the number of missed deadlines can also be reduced by up to 94% in the best case. Overall we conclude that redundancy through duplicated tuples is indeed a powerful tool for increasing the resiliency to intermittent runtime timing errors.'),(8259,'conf/IEEEscc/HassanalieraghP15','Moeen Hassanalieragh||Alex Page||Tolga Soyata||Gaurav Sharma 0001||Mehmet Aktas||Gonzalo Mateos||Burak Kantarci||Silvana Andreescu','Health Monitoring and Management Using Internet-of-Things (IoT) Sensing with Cloud-Based Processing: Opportunities and Challenges.','285-292','2015','conf/IEEEscc/2015',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q57677521','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2015.html#HassanalieraghP15','New York, NY','Among the panoply of applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart and connected health care is a particularly important one.

It is hard to enumerate and maintain all variations possible. To solve this problem, we introduce a higher-order function that can take functions as parameters to allow function invocation. In concrete terms, we propose the following methods: (1) a hierarchical service composition description by introducing higher-order functions and (2) a method to implement (1) in an existing composite service execution system.

Such constraints need to be verified prior to the execution of a service in order to ensure correct service execution. In the case of composite services, the set of applicable constraints is derived from the service constraints defined over the individual service components that are part of the service plan. During the execution of a composite service, a constraint-aware composite service execution model can be used to manage and eventually operationally verify the service constraints prior to the corresponding service\'s execution. In addition to service constraints, other constraints might be imposed to put externally-defined restrictions on composite services. Such externally-defined restrictions are likely to be defined and become or cease to be applicable after the composite service has been assemble and deployed. Such a situation requires adaptation of the plan to a set of externally-defined constraints. Current web service composition adaptation approaches only focus on adaptation to failure in functional capabilities or Quality of Service (QoS) properties which can be dealt with re-construction of the composite service. However, we argue that adaptation to external constraints does not necessarily require changes in the plan of a composite service. In this paper, we define a constraint-based composite service model that not only considers service constraints, but also adapts composite plans according to new constraints that might add new restriction to the composite service at run time. A publicly available test set generator is used to compare the proposed solution with other existing service adaptation solutions.'),(8289,'conf/IEEEscc/LiuZJ15','Kai Liu||Deqing Zou||Hai Jin 0001','UaaS: Software Update as a Service for the IaaS Cloud.','483-490','2015','conf/IEEEscc/2015',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2015.72','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2015.html#LiuZJ15','New York, NY','With the development of cloud computing, there is a growing number of virtual machines (VMs) in the IaaS cloud.

Cascading failure tolerance is determined by the topology of the network and the degree of service interdependency. As to the former, we analyze cascading failure in scale-free, exponential, and random service networks. We find that scale-free topology has generally the highest tolerance. This is contrast to cascading failure in power network, where random topology provides better tolerance. For the latter, we find that the number of cascade failed nodes increases as the inverse of the average number of alternate services, e.g. Functionally equivalent services. This suggests that increasing the number of alternate services can significantly improve the network tolerance if each service only has few alternate services available.'),(8325,'conf/IEEEscc/JangRTM15','Kuk Jin Jang||Jungmin Ryoo||Orkan Telhan||Rahul Mangharam','Cloud Mat: Context-Aware Personalization of Fitness Content.','301-308','2015','conf/IEEEscc/2015',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2015.49','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2015.html#JangRTM15','New York, NY','Digital video content via broadcast television, Internet and other content distribution networks provide limited interaction for fitness and wellness activities.

In this paper, inspired by ant clustering algorithm, we propose an effective context-aware method to cluster sensors in the form of Sensor Semantic Overlay Networks (SSONs) in which sensors with similar context information gathered into one cluster. Firstly, sensors are grouped based on their types to create SSONs. Then, our meta-heuristic algorithm called Ant Clust has been performed to cluster sensors using their context information. Finally, a few useful adjustments have been applied to reduce the cost of sensor search process. Experiments show the scalability of Ant Clust in clustering sensors and significantly faster runtime on sensor search, when compared with existing systems.'),(8372,'conf/IEEEscc/GhanavatiWC015','Mojgan Ghanavati||Raymond K.

These preferences are generally, expressed as potentially objective functions often conflicting. Most of existing works trying to select the best web services are based either on a single evaluation criterion or, at best, on the use of an aggregation function like weighted sum of several quantitative evaluation criteria, or the use of the Pareto optimality notion. The work presented here addresses these shortcomings by introducing a new optimality notion based on two tests: (i) concordance and (ii) discordance tests.

Service composition security risk is measured by implementing the aggregation rules from the local security risk values of the aggregated services in the composition. We adapt the DREAD model for Security risk assessment by suggesting new categorizations for calculating DREAD factors based on a proposed service structure and service attributes. We implemented the YAFA-SOA Optimizer as an extension of an existing GA implementation to solve multi-objective optimization problems for varying number of objectives in the context of SOA. We evaluated the tool in a case study. The study results show that applying multi-objective GA is feasible to find the optimized security and cost in SOA-based systems. We were able to approve that adding security services to the generated composition reduces the risk severity of the generated composition and enhances its security in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA).

What distinguishes this paper from most work on demand-side management is our consumer-centric focus: we transform human and other-generated internal demand within the consumer to fit a prescribed shape for demand to be presented to an external utility. We recommend that the utility prescribe the shape. We also explain why setting tariffs by time-of-day, independent of the amount consumed, can put the utility at an economic disadvantage. Key contributions of our paper include (1) the design and exemplary operation of an estimator that selects a battery size likely to make feasible the periodic (e.g., daily) transformation of internal demand into a shape proportional to an input shape; (2) the design and exemplary operation of a system to perform the required reshaping based on various input forecasts and consumption history; (3) the suggestion that energy price discounts should be based on the daily shape of the demand, as opposed to tariffs based on time-of-day but independent of the amount of demand; and (4) a demonstration of the effectiveness of using forecasts to manage demand. We focus on the management of demand for electricity. However, our methods would apply in a variety of industries that use metered services for a commodity that can be stored. These commodities include water, natural gas and other fuels, and some internet services (e.g., streaming and cloud services, especially cloud storage).'),(8403,'conf/IEEEscc/HouZCCC16','Shou-lu Hou||Shuai Zhao 0001||Bo Cheng 0001||Yong-Yang Cheng||Junliang Chen','Fragmentation and Optimal Deployment for IoT-Aware Business Process.','657-664','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.91','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#HouZCCC16','San Francisco, CA','Modern Internet of Things (IoT)-aware business processes consist of various geographically dispersed sensor devices. Large amounts of raw data acquired from sensors need to be regularly transmitted to the targeted processes in enterprise data centers, which results in a significant increase in network traffic and latency. It is necessary to execute such processes in a distributed way. A major challenge for distributed business processes is to design an optimal fragmentation and deployment scheme to improve the overall performance of the process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel location-based fragmentation algorithm to partition a process, and apply the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to solve the optimal deployment of process fragments. These distributed fragments can collaborate together to complete a common goal by using a topic-based publish/subscribe infrastructure. This approach can reduce network traffic and save the process execution time. In our experiment, an integrated monitoring process is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Service-oriented analytic workflows can bring together various analytic computing tools and compute resources offered as services to answer complex research questions. The current healthcare system in United States is experiencing fundamental transformation as it moves from a volume-based business to a value-based business. One strategy that healthcare organizations start to deploy is leveraging their healthcare data to gain insights for optimizing their operation. Therefore it is perfectly logical to extend the application of service-oriented analytic workflows to population health studies, as these rely on both medical expertise and processing of large data sets to serve end users of various backgrounds and skill sets. However, in the practical application of such service oriented approach, the user often finds it difficult to choose the right services or workflows that can help them to find the answers to their questions. To tackle this problem, we propose a heuristic recommendation method based on the feature significance. The user submits an enquiry, then based on which, the system will recommend the services and compositions that are likely to produce meaningful answers. In this paper, we will elaborate the interactions between different roles in a service oriented analytic system, develop the modeling to illustrate the relations among enquiry, features, services and workflows, propose the algorithm for service recommendation, architect the system and show a reference implementation of a prototype.'),(8411,'conf/IEEEscc/BousselmiBG16','Khadija Bousselmi||Zaki Brahmi||Mohamed Mohsen Gammoudi','Energy Efficient Partitioning and Scheduling Approach for Scientific Workflows in the Cloud.','146-154','2016','conf/IEEEscc/2016',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2016.26','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2016.html#BousselmiBG16','San Francisco, CA','Energy consumption is emerging as a new crucial issue of the Cloud Computing environments such as data centers. The problem of power consumption is more challenging especially in the context of scientific workflows deployment in the Cloud as they trigger intensive computational tasks and data manipulation steps which begets excessive data movement operations over communication networks. For instance, it was revealed that network devices consume up to one-third of the total energy consumption of Cloud data centers. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware approach for scientific workflows scheduling in the Cloud. In the first step, we propose a Workflow Partitioning for Energy Minimization (WPEM) algorithm that allows reducing the network energy consumption of the workflow and the total amount of data communication while achieving a high degree of parallelism. In the second step, we use the heuristic of Cat Swarm Optimization to schedule the generated partitions in order to minimize the workflow\'s overall energy consumption and execution time. We evaluated the proposed approach using three real cases of data intensive workflows and compare it with other algorithms from literature. The experimental results show that our proposal allows to reduce remarkably the network energy consumption of the tested workflows (up to 96% of network energy consumption saving for memory intensive workflows) and the overall energy consumption of the workflows while ensuring a reasonable execution time and using less Cloud resources.'),(8412,'conf/IEEEscc/PaakkonenHA18','Pekka Pääkkönen||Antti Heikkinen||Tommi Aihkisalo','Architecture for Predicting Live Video Transcoding Performance on Docker Containers.','65-72','2018','conf/IEEEscc/2018',NULL,'SCC',NULL,NULL,'http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SCC.2018.00016','db/conf/IEEEscc/scc2018.html#PaakkonenHA18','San Francisco','Video can be streamed live with different applications (e.g. YouTube Live, Periscope).

When video is streamed live, transcoding has to be completed within real time constraints, which is a computationally demanding process. Particularly, live transcoding should be enabled efficiently by a content distributor to minimize resource provisioning costs. The contribution of this paper is an architecture for predicting live video transcoding performance on a Docker-based platform. Particularly, cloud resource management for live video transcoding has been focused on. A model was trained based on measurements in different transcoding configurations. Offline evaluation results indicate that live transcoding speed or CPU usage can be predicted with 3-8 % accuracy. When video is transcoded on virtual machines based on predictions in a prototype system (live), live transcoding speed prediction accuracy is within a similar range as the offline performance, but worse for CPU usage prediction (5-15%).

In the edge computing system, several servers are placed on the network edge near the IoT devices to process the offloaded tasks. A key issue in edge computing system is how to reduce the system cost while completing the offloaded tasks. In this paper, we study the task scheduling problem to reduce the cost of edge computing system. We model the task scheduling problem as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the system cost while satisfying the delay requirements of all the tasks. Then, we prove that the proposed optimization problem is NP-hard. To solve this optimization problem effectively, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, called Two-stage Task Scheduling Cost Optimization (TTSCO). We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing with optimal solutions. The results show that the approximate ratio is less than 1.2 for 95% of the data sets we use. Performance evaluation shows that our algorithm can effectively reduce the cost of edge computing system while satisfying the delay requirements of all the tasks.');
